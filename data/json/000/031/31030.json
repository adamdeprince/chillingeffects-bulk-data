{"dmca":{"id":31030,"type":"Dmca","title":"Defamation Letter from Homestead Technologies","body":"Dear Member,\r\n \r\nThe original message was to remove all mention of [private], including addresses, financial information and photographs or images of [private]'s property from your site.  While you have removed. [private]'s name, as well as the photographs or images, you still refer to her as '[private]'s daughter'.  Additionally, while you place the disclaimer:\r\n \r\n\"[private]'s daughters name, the addresses of the properties that she owns and their photographs have been removed (and replaced with stock photographs) because of a complaint that was made by [private]'s daughter to the website host.\r\n(The photos shown here are not pictures of homes owned by [private]'s daughter.)\",\r\n \r\nthe sale price for the property is listed on the page.\r\n \r\nUnfortunately, this still violates the Homestead Member Agreement clause regarding posting of personal information without that party's consent.  We have again removed the page.  Again, to reiterate, do not post any information about [private], including but not limited to addresses, photographs of property or financial information.\r\n \r\nRegards\r\n \r\nHomestead Abuse Team\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom: [private]@safe-mail.net\r\nSent: Thursday, July 05, 2007 7:14 PM\r\nTo: Share_HS_Abuse\r\nSubject: Re: RE: Homestead Abuse Team (esotericfreedom.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Homestead Abuse Team,\r\n \r\nRe:http://www.esotericfreedom.com/Properties\r\n \r\nI have reposted the following page and I have omitted [private]'s name, the addresses of the properties that she owns as well as the photographs of those properties.\r\n[private]'s information is in no other place on the website.\r\nI hope that this satisfies your request.\r\nBest wishes.\r\n \r\nhttp://www.esotericfreedom.com/Properties.html\r\n\r\n \r\n----- Original Message ----- \r\nFrom: Share_HS_Abuse \r\nTo: Share_HS_Abuse ; [private]@safe-mail.net\r\nSent: Thursday, July 05, 2007 8:40 PM\r\nSubject: Spam: RE: Homestead Abuse Team (esotericfreedom.com)\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Member,\r\n \r\nAs a passive conduit, we cannot monitor user websites, but we respond to breaches of our user agreement when we learn of such behavior.\r\n \r\nThe page following page had addresses and photographs of [private]'s property.
