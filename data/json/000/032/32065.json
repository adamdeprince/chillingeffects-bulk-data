The\r\nsite is http://www.batista-unleashed.com/index02.html\r\n<http://www.batista-unleashed.com/index02.html> \r\n \r\nThey have some pictures of mine on their site, in the photo gallery. The\r\npictures were NOT sent in by me. In fact, they were taken off a private\r\naccount and sent in by someone else. \r\n \r\nI have emailed the site several times, asking them to remove the\r\npictures. The pictures are personal and i do NOT want them on this\r\nsite.They have not done so yet. So i am asking you to take them down for\r\nme. \r\n \r\nThe direct links to the pictures are as follows:\r\nhttp://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/AutographSe\r\nssions/candid24.jpg\r\n<http://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/AutographS\r\nessions/candid24.jpg> \r\n \r\nhttp://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/Fans/fan-ca\r\nndid15.jpg\r\n<http://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/Fans/fan-c\r\nandid15.jpg>\r\n<http://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/Fans/thumb\r\n_fan-candid34.jpg> \r\n \r\nhttp://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/Fans/fan-ca\r\nndid34.jpg\r\n<http://www.batista-unleashed.com/PhotoGallery/albums/Candids/Fans/fan-c\r\nandid34.jpg> \r\n \r\nI think it is great for fans to gather and share pictures. But ONLY when\r\nthe pictures are sent in willingly. I felt violated when a friend told\r\nme that my pictures were on the site without my permission.\r\n \r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\n \r\nThank You,\r\nSarah Sanders","date_sent":"2006-04-24T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-24T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
