{"dmca":{"id":8150,"type":"Dmca","title":"I was just doing research for a paper!!","body":"Hello.  My name is Kim.  I am a psychology student and I was doing research for an upcoming essay, and I went to a website I read about in a forum, and the website is called Phreex.com.  When I typed the page in my browser, it came up to say this site has been taken down by the govt. and you will be investigated to the fullest extent of the law.  Something about terrorism.  Feel free to go to www.phreex.com and look at it.  Now I'm scared because they said I need to contact an attorney and it was an innocent thing!!  What am I to do?  What can they do to me?  Can anyone ease my anxiety?  I know you can't give legal advice, but at least tell me what the heck is going on?  Please :o)  I am really scared!!  I didn't mean to do anything wrong!!  Thanks for your time!   Please email me at kimianna@amaonline.com\r\n\r\nScared to death,\r\nKimberly Jones","date_sent":"2005-09-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-09-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Uncategorized","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"US Govt Webpage","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
