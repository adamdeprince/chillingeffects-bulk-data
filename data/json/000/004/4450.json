I am writing to request that you cease using the Opus Canis name on the web, including the \"opus-canis.net\" domain name, and in every other capacity. I regret any inconvenience this may cause you, and wish your endeavors great success under a different name.\r\n\r\nIn an overly litigious society, I hope you can appreciate my earnest attempt to solve the situation amicably, without resorting to threat or legal action.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you wish to proceed.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\n[private]\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nReceived on January 24, 2005 via email:\r\n\r\nMr. Pattison,\r\n\r\nTo my disappointment, I see that you continue to use our business name, \"Opus Canis\", despite my previous request that you cease and desist from doing so. On November 10, 2004, I sent you the e-mail attached below, to which you have failed to respond. I hope you will not choose to ignore this one.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[private]","date_sent":"2004-11-10T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-11-10T05:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Opus Canis, L.L.C.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
