Your intentional publication of the image will likely injure PUMA's reputation/ good name and excite adverse and derogatory opinions against PUMA. The image is obviously defamatory in nature and PUMA will not tolerate its continued use.\r\n\r\nFurther, your use of the offensive image infringes upon the trademark rights of PUMA in that it unlawfully depicts PUMA's registered trademarks, which are protected under various unfair competition and trademark laws and have been used by PUMA for many years.\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, PUMA demands that you IMMEDIATELY cease and desist from all further display, use and publication of the offensive PUMA image. If you fail to comply with these demands, please be assured that PUMA will vigorously protect its rights and will take all action necessary, including but not limited to, bringing a claim for damages and/ or injunctive relief. Nothing in this letter shall be construed as limiting, in any way, PUMA's legal/ equitable rights.\r\n\r\nYour prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2003-03-12T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-03-12T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":"CORPORATE COUNSEL","principal_name":"PUMA","recipient_name":"Gawker","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
