It is my belief that this duplication of my content has resulted in a penalty by Google. I have followed the template you provided and include the details as follows:\r\n\r\n1.The copyrighted work at issue is the text, graphic creatives, application code \r\n(.php and/or .asp files), contracts, etc... contained at the website www.200cash.com.\r\n2. Our site has been wholly copied and submittedto your search engine as original\r\nwork, in violation of our copyright as www.500-cash.us.\r\n3. I can be contacted by email at [private]@200cash.com, or by phone: [private]\r\n4. The whois information on 500-cash.us is attatched on pages 2 and 3.\r\n5. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above \r\non the allegedly infringing webpages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its\r\nagent, or the law.\r\n6. I swear. under penalty of perjury consistent with United States Code Title 17,\r\nSection 512, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the\r\ncopyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive\r\nright that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen upon inspection of the infringing site that there bas been blatant, wholesale duplication of our site. Many (but not all!) of the references to 200cash.com have been replaced by 500-cash.us. I believe that the similarity in names was selected to intentionally deceive the search engines into believing this was a duplicate site as we had enjoyed strong place under our highest volume keyword phrase \"payday loans\".\r\n\r\nTheir addition of Google Adsense Ads, I believe, is also an attempt to win your favor of stolen site over ours in a debate.\r\n\r\nFinally, it can be shown that literally none of the link partners on our site link to this copied site.\r\n\r\nI eagerly await confirmation of your actions in this matter, and a restoration of our site back to good standing. It has always been our policy to follow Google's Terms of Service rigorously and have enjoyed good results in the organic listing for quite some time. It is EXTREMELY frostrating to see this kind of feeble attempt\r\nto copy our success result in having us eliminated. (Unless of course this actually was their plan!)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your consideration.\r\nRegards,\r\n[private]\r\n200CASH.COM, INC\r\n[private]@200cash.com\r\nPhone: [private]\r\n\r\n\r\n500-CASH.US\r\nhttp://www.whois.us/\r\n.US Registry WHOIS Data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDomain Name\t\t500.CASH.US\r\nDomain ID\t\tD5872567 .us\r\nSponsoring Registrar\tOMNIS NETWORK, LLC.\r\nDomain Status\t\tok\r\nRegistrant ID\t\t[private]\r\nRegistrant Name\t[private]\r\n\r\nRegistrant Address1\t[private]\r\nRegistrant City\t\tBrooklyn\r\nRegistrant State/Province\tNY\r\nRegistrant Postal Code\t\t11214\r\nRegistrant Country\t\tUnited States\r\nRegistrant Country Code\t\tUS\r\n\r\nRegistrant Phone Number \t[private]\r\nRegistrant Email\t[private]@yahoo.com\r\nRegistrant Application Purpose \tP1\r\nRegistrant Nexus Category\tC11\r\nRegistrant Nexus Category \tOMNIS-NP-39\r\nAdministrative Contact ID \t[private]\r\nAdminisb'ative Contact Address\t[private]\r\nAdministrative Contact City\t BrookIyn\r\nAdministrative Contact State/Province\t NY\r\nAdministrative Contact Postal COde \t11214\r\nAdministrative Contact Phone Number \tUnited States\r\nAdministrative Contact Country Code \tUS\r\nAdministrative Contact Phone Number \t[private]\r\nAdministrative Contact Email \t[private]@yahoo.com\r\nTechnical Contact ID\tOMNIS-NP-39\r\nBilling Contact Name \t[private]\r\nBilling Contact Address\t[private]\r\nBilling Contact City\tBrooklyn\r\nBilling Contact State\tNY\r\nBilling Contact Postal Code \t11214\r\nBilling Contact Country \tUnited States\r\nBilling Contact Country Code \tUS\r\nBiling Contact Phone Number \t[private]\r\nBilling Contact Email \t[private]@yahoo.com\r\nTechnical Contact ID\tOMNIS-NP-39\r\nTechnical Contact Name \t[private]\r\nTechnical Contact Address1\t[private]\r\nTechnical Contact City\t\tBrookiyn\r\nTechnical Contact State \tNY\r\nTechnical Contact Postal Code \t11214\r\nTechnical Contact Country\tUnited States\r\nTechnical Contact Country Code \tUS\r\nTechnical Contact Phone Number \t[private]\r\nTechnical Contact Email\t\t[private]@yahoo.com\r\nName Server\tNS1.
