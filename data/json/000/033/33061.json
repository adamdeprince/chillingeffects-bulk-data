Here are the particulars:\r\n\r\n> 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on\r\n\r\n> behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nThis message contains my electronic signature.  I am the exclusive\r\ncopyright holder of the work in question and therefore am authorized to\r\nact in this matter.\r\n\r\n> 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been \r\n> infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site \r\n> are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such\r\nworks at that site.\r\n\r\nThe particular copyrighted work is a photograph of a pet hamster.\r\nThe original work is located on my website at the following URL:\r\nPage: http://pyropus.ca/personal/pets/moka-latte/page-16.html\r\nImage:\r\nhttp://pyropus.ca/personal/pets/moka-latte/20030112-latte-crazy-nails1.j\r\npg\r\n\r\n> 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or \r\n> to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or \r\n> access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably \r\n> sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\r\n\r\nThe infringing copy of my work is here:\r\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/2959/20030112lattecrazynails16aw.jpg\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the message board post where this user used my file is\r\nhere:\r\nhttp://www.detroitluv.com/index.php?topic=34324.0\r\n\r\nIn it, you can see he says:\r\n\r\n  Totally. If I really want to use it, guess what, right click, save as,\r\n  rehost, \"fuck you\".\r\n\r\n  Exactly.\r\n\r\n  Which brings me to the angry fucker I was going to post and now I've\r\nsaved\r\n  and reposted.\r\n\r\nIt clearly indicates intent to commit copyright infringement; it was a\r\ndeliberate act, and not a misunderstanding.  As such, I would think it\r\nwarrants complete termination of that users' account.\r\n\r\n> 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to\r\n\r\n> contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, \r\n> and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining\r\n\r\n> party may be contacted.\r\n\r\nName, address, phone number:\r\n\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n101 - 116 Research Drive\r\nSaskatoon, SK\r\nS7N 3R3\r\n(306) 382-4100 ext. 106\r\n\r\nEmail contact is preferred; you may reach me at this email address.\r\n\r\n> 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that\r\n\r\n> use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by \r\n> the copyright owner, it's agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI have not authorized this use of my copyrighted work, and it is not\r\nauthorized by the law.  I thus have a good-faith belief that this is an\r\ninfringing copy of my copyrighted work.\r\n\r\n> 6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, \r\n> and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized\r\n\r\n> to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly\r\ninfringed.\r\n\r\nThe information in this notification is accurate and made under penalty\r\nof perjury.  I am the copyright holder of the work in question, and\r\ntherefore am authorized to act on my own behalf.\r\n\r\nI trust this is sufficient for you to take action.  I would like the\r\ninfringing work removed immediately, and a statement that the user will\r\nnot be permitted to re-post the offending work to the server in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n--\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n<charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.org>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-06-16T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-06-16T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Charles Cazabon","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
