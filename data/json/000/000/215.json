{"dmca":{"id":215,"type":"Dmca","title":"Girl gets eaten by Shamu C&D","body":"Our firm represents The Anheiser Busch Companies which is the owner of the world famous Sea World and Shamu marks. Our client has recently learned of the website hosted on The Experiment entitled \"Girl Being Eaten By Shamu\" It goes without saying that the Anheiser Busch finds this use of its world famous mark to be offensive. It also violates its rights under the federal Trademark Act and the federal Dilution Act. Accordingly, Anheiser Busch is demanding through this letter that you end this violation of its rights and the tarnishment of its valuable Shamu mark immediately by taking down the site (or alternatively, deleting all references to the \"Shamu\" name) and agreeing that you will not use in the future the Shamu mark in this or any similar manner which would violate any of Anheiser Busch's right in that mark.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm to me in writing within ten (10) days from the date of this letter that you will comply with this request to permanently cease any use of the Shamu mark which would violate Anheiser Busch rights in that mark, including the \"Girl Being Eaten By Shamu\" use.\r\n\r\nIf we do not receive your written confirmation with the identified time, we will assume you are not interested in amicably resolving this matter at which time Anheiser Busch will take appropriate action.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2002-02-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-02-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Weinberg Sullivan, P.C.","principal_name":"Anheiser Busch Companies","recipient_name":"The Experiment","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
