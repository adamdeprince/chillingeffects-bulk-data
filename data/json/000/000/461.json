Since January 1, 2001 I've been trying to get Google and DMOZ to fix a typo that sent search engine leads for \"rewerx\" to \"rexwerx\".  DMOZ won't reply or acknowledge their error. It all starts here -- http://dmoz.org/Arts/Crafts/Glass/Blowing/Lampworking/ and gets picked up by other search engines and compounded.  Can you suggest any remedy?\r\n\r\nWell over a year ago (1/30/2001) I sent this (and since then numerous other notes):\r\n\r\n\"ReWerx is a trademarked name for a Canadian corporation.  It is also a\r\nregistered domain name.\r\n\r\nSomehow your site and its page\r\nhttp://dmoz.org/Arts/Crafts/Glass/Blowing/Lampworking/\r\nlists rewerx as a hyperlink to a group that sells glass pipes and bongs for smoking pot!  Naturally we're miffed.\r\n\r\nPlease correct and confirm the correction directly to:\"\r\n\r\nBruce Gillespie\r\nReWerx\r\n604-264-0010\r\nbg@rewerx.com\r\n","date_sent":"2002-04-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-04-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Linking"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Bruce Gillespie","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
