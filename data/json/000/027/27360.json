I do not\r\ngrant  \r\nlemonup.com permission to use it for any commercial purpose (they are  \r\ncurrently using it to make money through advertising). \r\n \r\nhttp://linuxresource.lemonup.com/ \r\n \r\nAlso lemonup commit slander of title by claiming copyright of my\r\noriginal  \r\ncontent on the above URL. \r\n \r\nMy first DMCA take-down request was on the 25th of April (and was\r\nacknowledged  \r\non the same day by a representative of lemonup.com).  It seems that the\r\n\r\noperator of lemonup.com is not responsive to DMCA requests and the  \r\nresponsibility for removing the pirate content falls on you. \r\n \r\n \r\nPS  I expect responses from both theplanet and hostgator.
