Most  \nreviewers have reviewed only this company, many of them twice and some  \nreviewed also a dentist (coincidently all the same dentist). We had a very\n \nbad experience with the company and when posting a negative review where  \nthreatened with damage to our property. Out of safety reseaons and as  \nadvised by the police, we took the review off. There is 3 other negative  \nreviews. All the rest is most likely fake to push the company's profile.\n\nRegards,\nKristina\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/place?cid=13413480064985836531&q=boiler+aid&hl=en&dtab=2&ie=UTF8&ll=51.541424,-0.207195&spn=0.000107,0.000172&t=m&z=13&vpsrc=0"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
