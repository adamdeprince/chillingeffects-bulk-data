I am\r\nthe designated agent of the registered owner of the copyrights for the\r\nimages and/or audio/visual works listed below. I believe your subscriber\r\nor account holder, identified below by the infringing IP address(es),\r\nused these works, at the dates and times cited below in a manner that\r\nwas not authorized by the owner of the copyrights, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI certify under penalty of perjury that I have a good faith belief the\r\ninformation contained in this notification is accurate to the best of my\r\nknowledge, and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the\r\naforementioned copyright-protected materials.\r\n\r\nThe verified and documented infringements listed below were traced to\r\nURLs and/or IP addresses controlled by your company. We demand that,\r\nupon receipt of this notification of claimed infringement, you\r\nexpeditiously notify the subscriber or account holder to whom you\r\nassigned the IP address(es) on the date(s) listed and demand that he or\r\nshe immediately remove the infringing material and cease and desist\r\ntrading or sharing TITAN Media property.  Under 17 U.S.C. 512(i),\r\nservice providers are not eligible for the limitations on liability\r\nestablished by 17 U.S.C. 512 [including those established in subsection\r\n(a)] unless they have adopted and reasonably implemented, and informed\r\nsubscribers and account holders a policy that provides for the\r\ntermination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and account\r\nholders who are repeat infringers.  Informing subscribers and account\r\nholders of acts of infringement is a crucial element to a policy\r\nproviding for the termination of repeat infringers.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of TITAN Media's\r\nlegal position, nor is it a waiver of any of our rights and/or remedies\r\nin this or any other matter, all of which are expressly reserved.
