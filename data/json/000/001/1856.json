(\"Mercury News\"). It has been brought to our attention that Hench Engineering, Inc. is, through its website at www.hench.net, copying and displaying copyrighted material of the Mercury News. I am writing to advise you that the copying and displaying of Mercury News materials by Hench Engineering must cease immediately.\r\n\r\nAt least one entire Mercury News article, \"Taxpayer Taxi,\" is reproduced verbatim on the Hench website, at the URL http://www.hench.net/2002/zO7O9O2d.htm. Hench's reproduction of this article unquestionably constitutes copyright infringement. The Taxpayer Taxi story was written by the Mercury News and published on July 9, 2002. It was also disseminated through the Mercury News website, www.bayarea.com. The copyrights to all such materials are owned by the Mercury News. No permission to copy and display this article or any other Mercury News materials has been sought or obtained from the Mercury News. Attached are copies of the Mercury News article as it appeared on the authorized bayarea.com site, and as copied and posted by Hench on hench.net.\r\n\r\nConduct precisely the same as that in which Hench is presently engaging has been held to constitute copyright infringement that is not protected as fair use. Los Angeles Times, et al. v. Free Republic, et al., 54 U.S.P.Q.2d 1453 (C.D. Cal. 2000). Permitting this article or any other Mercury News materials to continue to appear on the hench.net site would constitute willful infringement of the Mercury News' copyrights.\r\n\r\nHench must immediately remove the Taxpayer Taxi story as well as any other Mercury News materials from all websites it operates or controls, it must provide a list of all Mercury News materials removed, and it must certify that all such materials have been removed and that Hench will not permit the future posting of copyrighted materials of the Mercury News.\r\n\r\nIf these measures are not taken immediately, the Mercury News will take whatever actions it deems necessary to protect its interests. Please contact me promptly to confirm Hench's compliance with these requests.\r\n\r\nI certify under penalty of perjury that I am authorized to act on behalf of the Mercury News in addressing the infringement of its copyrights in this material.\r\n\r\nSincerely.\r\n\r\nGray Cary Ware & Freldenrich LLP\r\n\r\nBy:\r\n\r\n[private]\r\n[private]@graycary.com\r\n\r\nEnclosures\r\n\r\n\r\nbcc:\t[private]\r\n\r\n[attached exhibits]","date_sent":"2003-08-07T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-08-07T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Gray Cary Ware & Friedenrich LLP","principal_name":"San Jose Mercury News","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
