{"dmca":{"id":3219,"type":"Dmca","title":"Complainant Asks for Photo of Self to be Removed from Google","body":"Hello there.\r\n\r\nFor the third time now I find that Google has somehow re-indexed the\r\nhttp://www.warwick.ac.uk/gifted/summer-school/2002/images/khyle-westmoreland\r\n.gif [space in original] picture. I have already asked twice previously for this picture to be removed, and has [sic] been successful but it keeps returning to the search results. The strange thing is, the picture has not existed on the server for months, after asking the webmaster to remove it.\r\n\r\nCould you please remove it from the search results again, and preferably stop the Image search from ever indexing it again?\r\n\r\nFor formalities:\r\n\r\n1.\r\nhttp://www.warwick.ac.uk/gifted/summer-school/2002/images/khyle-westmoreland.gif, no.\r\n\r\n2.
