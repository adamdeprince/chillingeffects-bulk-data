Naidu owes a lot to  \nChowdary and he repaid him by getting him a Rajya Sabha ticket. Sujana  \nChowdary has no political experience [not that it is required for him to\nbe  \na rajya sabha member], but was given the seat inspite of several deserving\n \nheavy weights of the party.\n\nAnother fact is Chowdary belongs to the same caste as Mr. Naidu - Kamma.  \n\nTDP is heavily a kamma caste leadership. TDP has become a NTR family\naffair  \nsupported by the wallets of people like Sujana Chowdary. This party has  \ngone to the dogs. It cannot be a valid opposition party to the congress  \nanymore.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://fightindiancorruption.blogspot.in/2010/06/voice-against-corruption.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
