As you can imagine, this is very disturbing.  In addition to the\r\nstealing of my image and the unauthorized use of my name, these sites\r\nalso attempt to implant trojan horses and viruses to anyone foolish\r\nenough to access them without virus protection software. \r\n \r\nThe URLs for the offending websites are as follows:  porn-cat.org;\r\nebun.org; fetish-nylon.org; and xbdsm.org.  According to a Whois search,\r\nyou are the ISP for all of these websites.  All of the sites are\r\nregistered to Victor Shumer of BWA Ltd, out of Chad. \r\n \r\nThese websites infringe upon my rights, are libelous and may cause\r\ndamage to my reputation, and arguably violate my copyright in my\r\npicture.  This email is to demand that you shut down these sites\r\nimmediately.  Please note that I am a lawyer, and should you not take\r\naction to shut these website down, I am prepared to take whatever\r\nactions against your company I deem prudent, including not only\r\ncomplaining to your state regulators, but filing a lawsuit.  I would\r\nexpect that will not be necessary, but as you can understand this abuse\r\nis very disturbing. \r\n \r\nI appreciate your attention to this matter. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\nMichael Pignatella \r\n \r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nThe MSN Entertainment Guide to Golden Globes is here.
