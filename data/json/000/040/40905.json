Responsible people are informed about all significant events concerning the functioning of the information infrastructure on the 24x7 basis\r\n\r\nWe have developed a number of documents covering our Security Policy: General Network Usage Policy, Sensitive Information Encryption and Exchange Policies. General compliance with our security policy and regulations is ensured by the usage of logon scripts and Group Policies.\r\nStaff Security\r\nWe perform careful security checks of every person that is applying for a job. Confidentiality Agreements are an important part of the security system and every employee we hire is to sign such an Agreement. All the security-related cases and incidents are tracked and resolved by Department Managers. We inform all the people we hire about the Company\u2019s security standards and keep this knowledge up-to-date by organizing special training programs on regular basis.\r\nPhysical Security and Access Control\r\nWe imply a multi-level access control system. On the first level our security service is checking our employee\u2019s ID-badges to ensure they are authorized to access the building. The next level of access control is based on the usage of electronic cards, each possessing unique radio metrics, that are given to every employee that is authorized to access the floors of our buildings. We have installed effective video monitoring and alert systems in our offices and have arranged Governmental Security Service\u2019s (Police) protection of our property. The access control system is managed from one central control point, though each datacenter\u2019s security system is independent.\r\n\r\nAdditional capacities\r\nFor development purposes we use virtualization technology which enables us to build a separate operational environment for each project and thus increase resource allocation flexibility and effectiveness.\r\nSecurity Monitoring\r\nAll the processes are constantly monitored by the administrative team and vital information on all the important changes and incidents is tracked and logged via Syslog Server for future audit.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.influxive.com/business-continuity.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.iflexion.com/business_continuity/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
