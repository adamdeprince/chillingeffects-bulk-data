Chief Operating Officer,\r\n\r\nIt has come to our attention that a website hosted by yourselves has\r\nbreached our copyright, by taking text from OUR website, as detailed below.\r\nOur detailed travel guides take several weeks to research and write, and we\r\npride ourselves on our original content. I am sure you will appreciate our\r\nfrustration to find that this original content had been completely 'lifted'\r\nfrom our site without our consent.\r\n\r\nWe have contacted them twice using the email address of info@movilspain.com\r\non 16/03/05 and 25/3/2005, but have received no response whatsoever.\r\nTherefore, please would you arrange for these pages to be removed from your\r\nserver, as per our offical following Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)\r\nComplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDMCA complaint;\r\n\r\n1.
