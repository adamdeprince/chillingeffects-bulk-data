The Batterysavings.biz website simply refers people to the Batterysavings.com website. And through Batterysavings.biz, the infringement complained of in my prior letter is continuing.\r\n\r\n\r\nBattery-Biz has also discovered that the Batterysavings.com website is still appearing on Google searches in sponsored links despite your November 8, 2005 email which stated that these links were removed.\r\n\r\nBattery-Biz respectfully requests that pursuant to the DMCA and specifically, 17 U.S.C.
