Ron\r\nHubbard\r\nLibrary, Church of Scientology International (\"CSI\") and Church of\r\nScientology Flag\r\nService Organization (\"Flag\"), non-profit religious corporations, with\r\nrespect to\r\nintellectual property matters.   \r\n\r\n     RTC is the owner of the confidential Advanced Technology of the\r\nScientology\r\nreligion and the holder of exclusive rights under the copyrights applicable\r\nto the\r\nAdvanced Technology materials.  The Advanced Technology materials are\r\nconfidential,\r\nunpublished, copyrighted works.  RTC's works include, among others, the\r\nindividual\r\nworks comprising levels known as \"OT III\" and \"Class VIII Assists\".  These\r\nworks are\r\nregistered with the United States Copyright Office under registration\r\nnumbers: TXu 290\r\n496 and TXu 593 514.\r\n\r\n     The L. Ron Hubbard Library and Flag are also the owners of the\r\ncopyrights of a\r\nnumber of photographs appearing in its various publications. \r\n\r\n     RTC is also the owner of the federally registered  trademark and\r\nservice marks of\r\nthe Scientology religion which includes the \"Scientology Cross,\"\r\n\"Configuration of the E-\r\nmeter\", the signature of Mr. L. Ron Hubbard, and the \"Sea Org Symbol.\"\r\nThese marks\r\nare registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office under\r\nregistration\r\nnumbers 1,302,525; 1,012,452; 1,325,117; 2,056,778; 1,821,751, 1,334,758;\r\n1,326,867,\r\n0877, 948, 1,317,343.  RTC also owns the common law trademark rights to the\r\n\"SeaHorse Symbol\" consisting of a detailed artistic rendition of a seahorse.\r\nCSI is the\r\nlicensee of these trademarks.      \r\n\r\n     CSI and its sub-licensees use these trade and service marks in\r\nconnection with\r\nproviding religious and humanitarian services and counseling, seminars,\r\nbooks, classes,\r\nand lectures, among others.  These marks are also used extensively on the\r\nInternet.  For\r\nexample, many of these products, including a great number of books of the\r\nScientology\r\nreligion and services are promoted through various web sites, including\r\n\"scientology.org\", \"dianetics.org\", etc.  \r\n\r\nI.   Unauthorized Use of Copyrighted Materials.\r\n\r\n     We have been advised that one of The Planet's subscribers has placed\r\nRTC's, the\r\nL. Ron Hubbard Library's, and Flag's copyrighted works on The Planet's web\r\nsite\r\nwithout their authorization.  These works can be found under the following\r\nURLs:\r\n\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/nouveau_fichier190.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/secret-course.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/croyance-ot3.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/xenu.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/croyance-lrh.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/nouveau_fichier110.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/ot3.gif\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/nouveau_fichier191.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/puissance.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/clearwater.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/portrait.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/ron.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/ronadept.gif\r\n\r\n     Your subscriber's action in this regard violates United States\r\ncopyright law. \r\nAccordingly, we request your help in removing these copyrighted works.\r\n  \r\n     Our clients have obtained numerous permanent injunctions concerning\r\nInternet\r\ninfringements of these and similar works.  In RTC v. Lerma, Case No.\r\n95-1107-A, the\r\ncourt ruled in favor of RTC, permanently enjoining the defendant infringer\r\nfrom posting\r\non the Internet, the same OT III work that is one of the subjects of this\r\nletter.  A jury in\r\nthe United States District Court in San Jose, California assessed damages in\r\nthe amount\r\nof $75,000 against a Mr. Henson for copyright infringement, for posting\r\nanother of\r\nRTC's Advanced Technology works on the Internet.  Mr. Henson was also\r\npermanently\r\nenjoined by the court against further infringements. Three other United\r\nStates courts have\r\nissued permanent injunctions against Internet infringements of these and\r\nrelated works.\r\n\r\nII.  Unauthorized Use of Trademarks.\r\n\r\n     This Planet Internet subscriber has also placed the above specified\r\ntrademarks on\r\nhis website and has done so without the authorization of our client, RTC.\r\nThese\r\ninfringements can be found under the following URLs:\r\n\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/contrat-sea-org.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/e-meter.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/trs1.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/croixsci.gif\r\n\r\n     The use of these registered trademarks in this fashion has caused your\r\nsubscriber's\r\nname to be falsely associated with our client's registered marks as owner\r\nand creates a\r\nlikelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of this website in\r\nviolation of\r\nUnited States state and federal law, including the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u0015\r\n1125(a). \r\n\r\n     Likewise, our client's trademarks are famous, distinctive and unique.\r\nThe use of\r\nthe marks in this manner dilutes and tarnishes the distinctiveness of the\r\nmark in violation\r\nof the federal trademark antidilution statute, 15 U.S.C. \u0015 1125(c) and\r\nCalifornia's\r\nantidilution statute, California Bus. & Prof. Code \u0015 14330.

Cal. 1986).\r\n\r\n     The use of our client's marks in this manner also constitutes an\r\nunlawful false\r\ndesignation of origin and as such, violates \u0015 43(a) of the Lanham Trade-Mark\r\nAct.  This\r\nprohibits any use of another's trademarks that is \"likely to cause\r\nconfusion, or to cause\r\nmistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of\r\nsuch person with\r\nanother person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her\r\ngoods, services,\r\nor commercial activities by another person.\"  America Online, Inc. v.
