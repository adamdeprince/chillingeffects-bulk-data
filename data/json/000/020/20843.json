Moreover, to the extent that you or your agents are involved in uploading unauthorized copies of the MPAA member studios' copyrighted works onto third party websites to which your and/or other websites link, you must immediately and permanently desist from such activities.\r\n\r\nWe believe this information should prove sufficient for you to locate the infringing activities complained about herein and to remove links to copyrighted television shows and movies that are being unlawfully disseminated as a result of OnlyGreatStuff 's activities.\r\n\r\nWe are providing this notice based on our good faith belief that the use of motion pictures and television shows owned by the MPAA member studios in the manner occurring via OnlyGreatStuff are not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents or the law.
