There's no need to buy new seats if you move house or redecorate, as a new slipcover can give your furniture the makeover it needs in just a matter of minutes.  Many people like to have a spare set of slipcovers, so they can easily change the style of their whole room to suit the occasion or according to the seasons.\r\n\r\nSemi fitted stretch slipcovers have a unique one-piece design that features hidden elastic to hold the cover in place, for a smooth and snug-fitting finish.  The quality easy-care fabrics are all tested for durability, color-fastness and shrinkage, and can all be machine-washed when necessary.  Popular choices include twill, cotton, stretch denim, chenille and damask. \r\n\r\nThere's also a great selection of colors and patterns to choose from, to match to any style of d\u00e9cor.  We hope you find something on this website to inspire you to experiment with slipcovers as part of your home d\u00e9cor or simply to help you give your furniture a makeover on a budget.\r\n\r\nCheck out this short video clip from TVs The Balancing Act. Host Kathy Peterson and Sure Fit's Sherly Boltze demonstrate just how easy it is to fit a Sure Fit \u2122 slipcover. What really impressed me was how quickly they managed to transform their old leather couch into a modern and stylish new design.\r\n\r\nBut the real bonus it that it's machine washable - perfect if you have messy little tots! Sheryl says, \"I have a 5 year old at home and practically wash mine every month\".","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://how-to-do-it.net/how-to/2011/03/page/9/"},{"url":"http://how-to-do-it.net/how-to/how-to-do-fabric-furniture/"},{"url":"http://how-to-do-it.net/how-to/page/21/"},{"url":"http://how-to-do-it.net/how-to/tag/mixing-leather-and-fabric-furniture/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.getslipcovers.com/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
