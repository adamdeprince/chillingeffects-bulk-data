Todate (sic), the logo remains at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.oneparentfamily.com/images/header.jpg and at\r\nhttp://www.omeparentfamily.com/images/leave4ww.bmp but with this\r\nsecond example, he's added HIS URL to MY logo.\r\n\r\nThis has been my logo since late 1999 as seen at my site \r\nhttp://www.parentsworld.com/images/header.jpg and as seen in use on the \r\nWay Back Machine at\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20000118153302/http://parentsworld.com/index.html\r\nand can be seen still in use at my original URL at\r\nhttp://www.nucleus.com/~jlassali\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks of demand notices, he HAS removed SOME of the offending \r\nmaterials, but not all.  As shown with the logo, often the material is\r\nremoved only to be put back up at a later date.
