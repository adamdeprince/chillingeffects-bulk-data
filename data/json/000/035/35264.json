These people are NOT\r\nresellers for our products.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding with a more intense legal response with these illegal\r\nsellers, I am requesting you to remove the illegal material from your\r\nservers.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what action you take, and whether you can provide\r\ninformation to assist us to take further legal action.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention,\r\n\r\nDavid Petley\r\nSupport Manager, SWiSHzone.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCyrJMvK/XpJs6oyURAjmiAJsGeEMxLkZ+HUftgaUZG8wGDi4bfQCdGKsS\r\ntPpNEf3TLgDEwLimTlgCeEE=\r\n=Fqjl\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-07-02T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-07-02T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"SWiSHzone.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
