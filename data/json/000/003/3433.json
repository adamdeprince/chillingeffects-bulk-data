Wanted to share your work with My many fans & there should be a link to YOUR WORK & YOUR SITE.  I have fans from all over the world who enjoy hearing about My many travels and often buy from the merchants I recommend.    When I was in SANTA FE,  I purchased a ring of your design.  I am a great fan of your work.   \r\n \r\n \r\nAgain - I am happy to remove it - My webworker is in the Netherlands and will remove it  when he wakes up - which is our nighttime.  I hope you are agreeable to that.\r\n \r\n \r\nIn a message dated 6/5/2004 1:35:50 PM Pacific Standard Time, tvgoldsmiths writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoforia,\r\n\r\nWhen searching google.com under my name, Tresa Vorenberg, I found a postcard from my gallery which had been illegally scanned in producing a link to your sight.
