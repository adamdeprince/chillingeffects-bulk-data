{"dmca":{"id":10493,"type":"Dmca","title":"Marriot Harrison complains of infringing material","body":"Dear Sirs,\r\nWe refer to our recent correspondence in which you kindly removed links to defamatory material from your search engine. A Google Search of today (copy herewith) reveals a new article. This concerns the same set of underlying circumstances to which other articles have referred. In terms, the article (copied herewith) suggests that two former solicitors in this firm conspired to conceal information from a client and that the said solicitors were \"crooked\". All of these allegations are untrue and, indeed, the basis upon which the Law Society is reviewing matters pursuant to a direction from the Legal\r\nOmbudsman has been misrepresented in the Official Wire article. The article also alleges that Adrian Murtagh, a former solicitor at this office, was a liar; again this is untrue.\r\nThe article itself is highly defamatory and, once again, we should appreciate your removing the link from your search engine.\r\nWe await hearing from you accordingly. Yours faithfully,\r\nMarriott Harrison\r\nemail: tony.morris@marriottharrison.co.uk\r\n","date_sent":"2006-02-17T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-02-17T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","International"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Tony Morris","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
