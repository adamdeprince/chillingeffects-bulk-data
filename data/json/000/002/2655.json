{"dmca":{"id":2655,"type":"Dmca","title":"Wikipedia: [Private] page, and all related pages - immediate action required.","body":"Greetings, \r\n\r\nThis email is being wrtten to demand that the Wikipedia web page for \"[Private]\" as well as all related pages (including but not limited to the \"Talk\" page) be deleted from your web servers immediately. All current and former edits of this page are to be deleted. These pages contain libelous content which, if maintained, can and will result in litigious action against Wikipedia and it's owners. \r\n\r\nIf this action is not taken within 48 hours of the time this email was sent, a certified and registered letter will be sent via United States Post. You will then have 7 days from the reciept [sic] of that letter to take appropriate action. \r\n\r\nI would prefer to avoid these measures, but can no longer tolerate inaction in this case. This is not the first time I have contacted you about the situation. If you are NOT the person to contact about the issue, I suggest you inform me of who that person is at once. \r\n\r\nThis is the last email that will be sent in this matter, \r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe following notes are not part of the notice:\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia is an online wiki-based encyclopedia and hosts content writen by others. As such, the Communications Decency Act, Carafano v. Metrosplash and Zeran v. AOL will apply and should provide an effectively complete defence against this claim, since the Wikipedia is not the creator of the material. If you wish to communicate about this matter, editing text at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Easter_Bradford is preferred.\r\n","date_sent":"2004-01-14T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-01-14T05:00:00Z","topics":["Defamation","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Wikipedia","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
