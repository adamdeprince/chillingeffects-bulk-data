As an ISP, we are compelled by Federal Law to disable access\r\nof website if it infringes copyright or trademark rights of third parties. This is\r\nnot the case since the website www.uncoverthe.net neither uses the Trademark UNCOVER\r\nTHE NET on his website nor has UNCOVER THE NET content display there. As the\r\ndisputed material is the domain name and it is not under our control, because it was\r\nnot registered with us. This issue should be resolved either by the registrar of the\r\ndomain name uncoverthe.net or ICANN.\r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuse@theplanet.com [mailto:abuse@theplanet.com] \r\nSent: Wednesday, February 14, 2007 7:55 AM\r\nTo: DMCA\r\nSubject: [ThePlanetAbuse-C3081114P] Trademark Infringement (Uncoverthe.net)\r\n\r\n==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n1.
