I usually shop by price, but service matters too. I received BOTH from TapeOnline and more. I easily found the product on their site and the specific amount I needed, the prices were very good, and processing was easy. I received excellent follow-up communication, and the items arrived quickly by FedEx, nicely packaged with no damage. It was a pleasant suprise to find a package of candy inside the box too. Compared to many of the other online media companies I have dealt with in the past, and some of the service nightmares, TapeOnline is head and shoulders above the rest!

They are affordable, dependable and quick to respond. I buy all of my professional video tape through them and have never had a problem. Once when I ordered the wrong tape stock, they noticed the odd change in purchase behavior and contacted me to see if it was a mistake.
