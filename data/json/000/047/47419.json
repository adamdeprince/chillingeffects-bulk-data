I have already sent you the entire file, including all documents pulled from the LA Court nearly\r\nfour years ago.  It is not my responsibility to maintain your email\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nIf you remove all defamatory postings, I will withdraw the action and,\r\nrequest that my filing agent again pull the file on the action in LA Court.\r\nYour emails usually get blocked by the spam filter, so if you wish to\r\ncommunicate with me, my number is below.\r\n\r\n\r\n(private)\r\n............................................\r\nhttp://portland.indymedia.org/en/2008/03/373258.shtml\r\n(private)\r\n\r\nhttp://milwaukee.indymedia.org/en/2008/03/209471.shtml\r\n(private)\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2008-04-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-04-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":"(private)","principal_name":"(private)","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
