{"dmca":{"id":12915,"type":"Dmca","title":"Author complains of blog copying","body":"Dear Sirs,\r\n\r\nMy two works, entitled Notes on Living Cheaply in Paris, and How to Pack Light, are copyrighted by me. However a user of blogspot.com named [private] has deliberately infringed my copyright and has posted a great many verbatim parts of each in her blog zacksucks.blogspot.com. She even states her intention to ignore my copyright. So many parts have been copied that it goes beyond mere quotations. Therefore I am asking you to please shut down her blog. She has assembled a collection of parts of my works which nearly complete large sections of my works. \r\n\r\nMy URLs: \r\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~zilax/paris2.html\r\nhttp://home.comcast.net/~zilax/PL.html\r\n\r\nInfringing web pages/blogs:\r\nhttp://zacksucks.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nI would also like to ask that you block her from creating another blog that infringes again, if possible.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that the use of copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by me, because I am the copyright owner and I have never told this person [private] that she may use my works.\r\n\r\n[signed] \r\n[private]\r\nJuly 27th 2006\r\n\r\nAlso, I swear under penalty of perjury that the information in this notifications is accurate, that I am the copyright owner, and that I have exclusive right to my works. \r\n","date_sent":"2006-07-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-07-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"[Author]","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
