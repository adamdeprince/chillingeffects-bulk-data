(\"Moneris\"), which facilitates Merchant Services Agreements on behalf of Harris Bank.  It has come to our attention that your company's website (oncle.com) has posted a Harris Bank Merchant Services Agreement without the permission of Harris Bank or Moneris.  The information contained on the document on your website indicates that it was obtained in some manner from Udate.\r\n\r\nAs you know, use of the Merchant Services Agreement and/or the Harris Bank or Moneris name without the permission of Harris and Moneris is unlawful and will cause significant damages to Harris Bank and Moneris.\r\n\r\nHarris Bank and Moneris hereby notify you that the actions taken by your company are unlawful, and, as such, actionable.  Therefore, we demand you remove the Merchant Services Agreement and any other Harris/Moneris documents or references immediately and permanently.
