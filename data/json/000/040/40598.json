You will also note that the MBA Directory section on the infringer's\r\nwebsite ( <http://www.welcomeyou.net/business-schools-directory.html>\r\nhttp://www.welcomeyou.net/business-schools-directory.html) still links\r\nstraight through to our site that they have copied at MBA360.com.\r\n \r\nIn addition, the same principals have just registered the domain name\r\n<http://www.mba360.net> http://www.mba360.net on 5th February 2005, which\r\nthey are also hosting with your company, albeit with no content on the site\r\nyet. This gives me cause for concern and we will be monitoring this\r\nsituation closely.\r\n \r\nAs the Web hosting provider of the infringer, please contact the Web site\r\nowner as per your terms of service and grounds of termination policy to\r\nresolve this matter as soon as possible.  Please note that if you allow this\r\ninfringement, you are also considered in violation of the Berne Convention\r\nand the Digital Millennium Act, once notified by the true owner of the\r\ncopyright.\r\n \r\nPlease ensure all current infringing content is removed immediately.\r\n \r\nI look forward to hearing from you as a matter of urgency so this matter can\r\nbe resolved amicably and satisfactory for all parties concerned.\r\n \r\nThank you for your help in this matter.\r\n \r\nKind regards,\r\n \r\nNeil Williamson\r\nDirector, \r\n360 Investments Limited\r\nExchange Tower,\r\n19 Canning Street,\r\nEdinburgh, EH3 8EH\r\nUnited Kingdom","date_sent":"2005-03-31T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-03-31T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"360 Investments Limited","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
