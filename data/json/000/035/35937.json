They consist of private, personal and intimate pictures of her of a highly graphic, sexual nature that were stolen from her and have been posted online (including on these sites). Their continued publication and availability online through Google amounts to a clear breach of the terms of the anti-harassment injunction granted by the High Court in London.\n>  \n> AMP has become suicidal over this matter and it is critical that Google does what it can to remove any links to these pictures or anything that reveals her true identity.\n>  \n> To that end please also remove the following URLs and/or any search results that might lead to these URLs being able to be accessed:\n>  \n> http://cryptome.org/0005/AMP-v-Unknown.pdf\n>  \n> http://chillingeffects.org/N/88791\n>  \n> http://www.xydo.com/articles/42421901-photos_dmca_copyright_complaint_to_google\n>  \n> http://dataopedia.com/chillingeffects-org\n>  \n> http://cryptome.org/info/index.html\n>  \n> http://nyinayminproxy1.appspot.com/cryptome.org\n>  \n> http://page2rss.com/deb36db488f175511ebd77b98603b50f\n>  \n> http://www.scribd.com/doc/77476749/UK-Court-Order-of-Threat-to-Torrent-Seeders\n>  \n> Again, the publication and availability online through Google of anything that reveals AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true identity (which, for example, the Chilling Effects URL does on its final pages by appending to the anonymised court judgment her DCMA request which my firm filed in 2011 using her real name) amounts to a clear breach of the terms of the anti-harassment injunction granted by the High Court of London.\n>  \n> I very much understand that it is not easy for Google to remove these URLs or searches that might lead internet users to be able to access the photographs complained of or to unmask AMP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s true identity. Equally, however, Google algorithms are programmed to prevent successful searches for information being made by paedophiles, terrorists or others intent on criminality. To that end the steps I have asked for clearly can be taken by Google.\n>  \n> There are occasions where standing up for freedom of expression is right and proper. I stand alongside Google in that regard 99.99% of the time. This, however, is not such a time. On a human level I hope that you can see why the continued harassment of AMP is causing her such trauma.\n>  \n> I therefore very much hope that in addition to taking the steps requested you can suggest a way in which I might be able to liaise more effectively with you to have any further breaches of such an order addressed as quickly as possible.\n>  \n> Yours faithfully\n>  \n> Donal Blaney\n> Director & Principal\n> Griffin Law, Solicitors & Commissioners for Oaths\n> \n> LONDON:\n> 25 Southampton Buildings\n> London WC2A 1AL\n> Tel: +44 (0)20 7152 6558\n> Fax: +44 (0)20 7152 6559\n> Mob: +44 (0)7957 396226\n> (Consulting Offices: By Appointment Only)\n> \n> KENT:\n> 10 Churchill Square\n> Kings Hill\n> West Malling\n> Kent ME19 4YU\n> Tel: +44 (0)1732 525923\n> Fax: +44 (0)1732 525924\n> Mob: +44 (0)7957 396226\n> DX: 92853 West Malling\n> \n> Email: donal@griffinlaw.co.uk\n> Website: www.griffinlaw.co.uk\n> \n> Twitter: http://twitter.com/griffinlawuk \n> Facebook: http://bit.ly/93JOKJ \n> YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/user/GriffinLawSolicitors\n> LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/companies/1042153\n> \n> Wouldn't you like the scales of justice tilted in your favour for once?\n> \n> Service by fax, email or other electronic means not accepted.\n> \n> This e-mail is confidential and may also be privileged.
