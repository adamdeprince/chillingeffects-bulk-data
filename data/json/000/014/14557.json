Please contact us immediately to discuss the required changes on your group. The changes are quite simple and it is very important that we use the trademark correctly so that we don't lose our right to the trademark.\r\n \r\nIf you do not contact us within 48 hours of this note your group may be removed from the Freecycle.org official group listings. Please help us defend the Freecycle name as standing for your nonprofit goodwill alone in your city. \r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\nJoAnne\r\nFreecycle(TM) Trademark Representative\r\ntrademark2@freecycle.org\r\n ","date_sent":"2006-06-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-06-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"\"Freecycle Trademark Representative\" <trademark2@freecycle.org>","recipient_name":"NobleCountyFreecycle","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
