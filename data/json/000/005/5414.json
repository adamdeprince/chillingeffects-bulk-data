We enclose copies of the relevant pages for your information and ease of reference. As will be readily apparent, the articles contain a number of serious allegations against our client. \r\n\r\n[redacted]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that these articles contained libels actionable under English law which are damaging to our client. It is also clear that given the existence of the links on Google to which we have referred the articles must have been published in England notwithstanding that Designtechnica is based in the USA and that, so long as those links remain in place, there is a strong likelihood that further publications will take place in England.\r\nIn the circumstances, we must ask that all necessary steps are taken as soon as possible to remove any links to Designtechnica relating to our client.\r\nPlease confirm within 7 days (i.e. by 25 March 2005) that such steps have been taken. \r\nYours faithfully\r\n[Private]\r\nEnc: Copies of web pages\r\n","date_sent":"2005-03-18T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-03-18T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","International"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Scheidegger MIS","recipient_name":"Google UK Ltd.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
