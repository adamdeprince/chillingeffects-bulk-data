It was brought to our attention that few of your members have downloaded our images and are promoting them on your site. This is completely unacceptable. I am pretty sure that you are not aware of this, however, we need to figure out a way so that you know which ones are our images and that they are taken down IMMEDIATELY. All images under the name Sean Cody should be taken down immediately. I do not want to escalate this situation and to get our attorneys involved. Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe have all rights to ALL Seancody images. No one other than us(Cody Media) is allowed to copy, distribute and profit from these videos.\r\n\r\nNot only is it illegal for your firm to post adult content without the 2257 information, you're also directly violating our copyright of Cody Media. When it comes to the pirating of our images, we take these matters seriously. What are your future plans for insuring that our content not only doesn't appear on your website, but stays off?\r\n\r\nHere is the permalink-\r\nhttri://toninparis.blopspot.com/2006R Oltanner.htrnl \r\nhttp:/Jtominparisbloqsoot.com/2006/1 Q/ross.html \r\nhttp://tominpariabloasoot com/2006/1 0/bound html \r\nThe same images can be found on Seancody.com.
