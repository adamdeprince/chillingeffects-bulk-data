Pursuant to the Google Inc. (\"Google\") Terms of Service, which state in part:\r\n\r\n\"It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Web Site, http://lcWeb.loc.gov/copyright/) and other applicable intellectual property laws, which may include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity.\"\r\n\r\nFaronics hereby requests that Google remove or disable access to material that is the subject of this infringing activity.
