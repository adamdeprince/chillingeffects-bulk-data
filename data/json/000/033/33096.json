The IFPI is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies are some 1,450 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies\r\nin matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including\r\nenforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting infringing files on its network\r\n(see above-referenced directory).  These files contain sound recordings by\r\nthe artists known as 2 Pac, 311, 50 Cent & Akon. These sound recordings are\r\nowned by some of our member companies and have not been authorized for this\r\nkind of use.  We have a good faith belief that the above-described activity\r\nis not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  We assert\r\nthat the information in this notification is accurate, based upon the data\r\navailable to us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing files\r\nfrom your system or that you disable access to the infringing files.  In\r\naddition, please inform the site operator of the illegality of his or her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice. In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement. This letter does not constitute a waiver of any\r\nright to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized\r\nactivities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly\r\nretained.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou may contact me at IFPI Secretariat, 54 Regent Street, London W1B 5RE,\r\nUnited Kingdom or email Notices@ifpi.org, to discuss this notice.  We await\r\nyour response.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nSent on behalf of Mr Paul Mitchell\r\n\r\n\r\nInternet Anti-Piracy Administrator\r\n\r\nIFPI Secretariat\r\n\r\n54 Regent Street\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon W1B 5RE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTel: +44 (0)20 7878 7915\r\n\r\n\r\nFax: +44 (0)20 7878 6832\r\n\r\n\r\nE-mail: Notices@ifpi.org\r\n\r\nWebsite:  <http://www.ifpi.org/> www.ifpi.org\r\n\r\n ","date_sent":"2006-01-23T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-23T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"IFPI","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
