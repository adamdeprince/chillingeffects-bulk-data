It is my unfortunate responsibility to inform\r\nyou that this forum is using some images of mine, after I withdrew\r\npermission for them to do so.\r\n    At the time when I made the images in question I had a position of\r\nresponsibility on that forum. I made and submitted the images for use as\r\n\"Member Tags\" on the site, to denote ranks. At the time, no formal\r\nagreement was made over the terms of their use, as it was between\r\nfriends, and I could see no reason why I should want them removed\r\nanyway. However, the position was withdrawn from myself and my\r\ncolleague, and given to another person. I, however, was still active at\r\nthe forum, and as such, was still happy for my work to be used.\r\n    Later on however, I was banned from the site (in fact for having two\r\naccounts there), and moved my custom to a competing forum of a similar\r\ngenre. Just recently I felt compelled to revisit, and made another\r\naccount there. Technically speaking, this is against their rules, but I\r\nam glad I did so because I learnt that they they are still using my\r\nMember Tags for some of their members. Since I am technically banned,\r\nand am most certainly not a loyal member of their site any longer, I\r\nhave requested that the tags' use be stopped. Unfortunately, I received\r\nan immature response from their main administrator, which was most\r\ninsulting. I feel this is the only way to have the full impact of their\r\nactions addressed, since I believe (and I may be wrong) that this is a\r\nbreach of the Intellectual Property Copyright I hold over the images.\r\n    I hope that you can help me out, or refer me to the company who can.\r\n\r\nI eagerly await your reply.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\n    Joseph Clark, MIOS","date_sent":"2006-04-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"MIOS","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
