Paid for by myself and all  \nreproduction of any picture was done with my consent. This blogger does\nnot  \nhave permission to use any pictures of me. He also has a picture along\nwith  \nothers that have been altered. One with my head shot on another body with \n\nBNP leader Nick Griffin. If you scroll down the whole article you will see\n \nother pictures where the same has been done....the original picture I had \n\ncrutches. This was taken illegally in Lincoln County Court by Michael\nBrown  \nand given to Barking spider. There is a clear sign in the Magistrates\ncourt  \nthat \"No pictures are to be taken past the entrance doors\". If you notice \n\nthe right hand side of the picture has been cut. That is because it shows \n\nclearly the waiting area in LCC. I have reported this to the Magistrates, \n\nthe police are involved, and I have supplied them with copies of that  \npicture and the others where they just use my head.\nHe has also posted the video without permission from myself or the TV   \nnetwork on the following site","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://eyetube.me/"},{"url":"http://wwwbarkingspider.blogspot.com/search?q=andrew+gatward"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
