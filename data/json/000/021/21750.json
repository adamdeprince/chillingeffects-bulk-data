We were recently notified of your site, which provides links to articles on chemistry that have been posted on the web.\r\n\r\nWhile we support efforts to increase discoverability, we are compelled to inform you that many of the articles to which you link are in fact illegally posted, and that by linking to them, your site may be accused of contributory infringement.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, I have attached to the letter (Annex A) a list of illegal copies of our articles to which your site linked as of March 1. Generally, Wiley's copyright policy does not allow for the posting of final articles in PDF on author or third-party sites. We do, however, allow authors to self-archive non-final versions. If you wish to check with us as to whether a copy is authorized prior to linking, we would be happy to check. In the meantime, please disable the links, and please refrain from creating links to final articles posted on the web.\r\n\r\nThis letter is without prejudice.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n[Signature]\r\n\r\n[List of allegedly illegal copies not submitted to ChillingEffects.org]\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-04-04T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-04-04T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Linking"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"John Wiley & Sons","recipient_name":"ChemRefer Limited","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
