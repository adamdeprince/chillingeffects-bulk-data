(10:55 p.m.).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur clients take grave exception to the totally false and unjustified allegations that our clients and their employees are incompetent, are wasting the Government?s money, are undeserving of those funds and that Mr Robinson has been misrepresenting his linguistic knowledge and is guilty of misrepresentation and fraud.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe impact of these scurrilous allegations on our clients has been compounded by your endorsement of the allegations in the final paragraph of the posting.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe demand that you immediately remove these outrageous defamatory allegations from your web site forthwith and agree to publish a full retraction and apology in terms to be first agreed with us.  We also require your proposals for compensating our clients for the serious damage caused to their reputation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe await hearing from you within the next seven days, failing which we have\r\n\r\ninstructions to institute legal proceedings against you without further notice.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n[private]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTELE:  028 90240183","date_sent":"2005-11-22T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-11-22T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":"Johnsons, Solicitors","principal_name":"Ulster Scots Academy Implementation Group","recipient_name":"languagehat.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
