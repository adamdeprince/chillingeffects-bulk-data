This is very concerning as it is effecting me in my personal and \n\nmy professional life. Could I please have all of these links removed from \n\nweb search as they are defaming my character. I do believe it is unfair  \nthat one or two persons can ruin your life online for no reason. If the  \nsites are no down within a reasonable timeline, I will have to proceed\nwith  \nlegal actions. I have no intent on doing so as i want this matter to be  \ndealt with calmly.\n\nThanks.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://thedirty.com/2012/02/a-douchebag-scam-artist/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
