Ms. Yi is the owner of rights of publicity and privacy in\r\nher name and image. \r\n\r\n        Notwithstanding this, it has come to our attention that a web\r\nsite located at\r\n\"http://www.adultfanclubs.net/pseek/Adults_Only/Celebrities/Centerfolds/\r\nY/Yi,044_Natasha/,\" for which you are a service provider, links\r\nunauthorized reproductions of Ms. Yi's image.  The distribution of these\r\nimages, as well as the use of Ms. Yi's name in metatags and/or use of\r\nMs. Yi's name to increase traffic on this web site, violates Ms. Yi's\r\nrights of publicity and privacy. Further, based on the fact that some of\r\nthe images on the above-referenced web site appear to have been\r\nillegally copied from copyrighted photographs, this web site may also\r\ninfringe the rights of various copyright owners.\r\n\r\n        On behalf of Ms. Yi, we request your assistance in the removal\r\nof all unauthorized depictions of Ms. Yi from this web site and any\r\nother sites for which you act as an Internet service provider.  As you\r\nmay know, failure to remove such infringing content from this web site\r\nmay expose you to liability for contributory infringement of Ms. Yi's\r\nrights.  Please contact me to discuss this matter at your earliest\r\nconvenience.\r\n \r\n        Nothing in this letter shall be construed as a waiver or\r\nrelinquishment of any right or remedy possessed by Natasha Yi or any\r\nother affected party, all of which are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n        /s/\r\nDavid K.
