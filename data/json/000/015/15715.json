Marks and Logos.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, your use of our client's copyrighted works subjects you to liability under the federal Copyright Act.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that you might claim to have believed that your actions were permitted by the Terms of Use of the Farmers website (which you copied and display on your site), you are wrong and, in any event, you should consider this letter to constitute official notice that any such permission (which, in fact, was nonexistent) is hereby immediately revoked.\r\nYou are entitled to criticize Farmers in whatever public forum you choose, including the Internet. You are not, however, entitled to make unauthorized commercial use of our client's valuable trademarks to cause confusion and to improperly channel increased traffic to your website and to Farmers' competitors, nor are you entitled to make unauthorized use of our client's copyrighted material.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we demand that you immediately cease and desist from the illicit and deceptive conduct described above and that you immediately remove our client's Logos and copyrighted materials from your website and any other website you own or operate.
