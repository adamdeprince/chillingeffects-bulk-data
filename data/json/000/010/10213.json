Those words also evoke feelings of warmth, nostalgia, comfort and contentment.  Much of that is with good reason as the Irish cottage was, for two hundred years, a great feature on the Irish landscape and home to millions of Irish people, many of whom emigrated to the United States and elsewhere.   The thatched Irish cottages were simple affairs, and while the basic design was the same throughout the country, there were differences on a regional basis. One major regional difference would have been the use of mud walls, rather than stone, in some areas.  Strange as it seems, when the mud walls were dried and given several coats of whitewash, and when the thatched roof was allowed to overhang the walls, they remained dry and lasted for many decades. \r\nCottages Ireland  Rental Cottages Ireland Cottage rentals Rent a cottage vacation cottage","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://blackberryjamcafe.blogspot.com/2010/03/irish-cottages-romantic-and-cozy-ivy.html"},{"url":"http://nobleart.uk.net/index.php/ireland-images.html?dir=desc&mode=list&order=position"},{"url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/floweringwoman/2684999136/"},{"url":"http://www.pidcock.com.au/blog/2010/12/2/architecture-and-leprechauns"},{"url":"http://www.travelmania-ireland.com/cottages.php"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.ballybegvillage.com/irish_cottages.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
