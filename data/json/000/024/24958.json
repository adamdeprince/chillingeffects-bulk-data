Cases like this are badly hurting our business, as we already\r\nhad many complains from our own customers. We are actually loosing\r\norders and money because of this.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDan Rokosz\r\nwww.austinhamilton.ca\r\n\r\nCopyright wrote:\r\n> To Whom It May Concern:\r\n> \r\n> Please note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice does\r\nnot\r\n> substantially comply with the required notification elements of the\r\n> Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n> \r\n> Please note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of your\r\n> claim.\r\n> \r\n> Please visit our web site at\r\n>\r\nwww.theplanet.com/about_us/legal_docs/ThePlanet%20Copyright%20Infringeme\r\n> nt%2001%2015%2007%20FINAL.pdf\r\n>  \r\n> Legal Response Team\r\n> THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n> ==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n> 1. www.beadmaninc.com - stolen content on the website\r\n> Added by system at Thursday, Jun 7 2007 07:10 am \r\n> X-MailFrom: austin@austinhamilton.ca \r\n> X-RcptTo: abacus@abacus.ev1servers.net \r\n> Received: from [216.12.192.67] by [216.12.192.78] (abacus) for\r\n> <abacus@abacus.ev1servers.net>;
