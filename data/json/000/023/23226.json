So i do not have to submit a\r\nDMCA and get this all out of hand. I called the person on the domain contact\r\ninformation and they said they where going to take it down and have yet to\r\ndo so. I read the planets TOS and see that they do not permit the use of\r\ncopywrited material on there servers.\r\n\r\nHope this can be settled. Thanks, Anthony Gaston.
