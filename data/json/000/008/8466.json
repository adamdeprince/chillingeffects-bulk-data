In general, we  \ngravitate towards people that we consider similar to us. Rapport is an  \nessential basis for successful communication - if there is no rapport\nthere  \nis no real communication! We naturally experience rapport with close  \nfriends or in the company of those with whom we share an intense common  \ninterest. However the ability to create rapport is a skill that can be  \nlearned and which can be used to facilitate our relationship with anybody,\n \nin any setting, and even with those with whom we profoundly disagree.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.eu-forums.com/love/how-to-get-acquainted-with-a-girl-t927.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.nlp-now.co.uk/rapport.htm"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
