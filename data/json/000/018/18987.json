She is welcome to leave a review, but I draw the\n \nline at accusations of bullying and robbery. I have sought legal advice on\n \nthe matter and she has backed down, but these remaining baseless  \naccusations of \"feeling bullied and robbed\" are libelous and I believe\nhave  \na negative effect on my business. If required, a full copy of  \ncorrespondence between her and myself is available for viewing, and\nclearly  \nshows that she is simply quite crazy.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF8&cid=18052144925210392835&q=Fettle.IT&iwloc=A&gl=GB&hl=en_uk"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
