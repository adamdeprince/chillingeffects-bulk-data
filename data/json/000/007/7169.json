That said, we would appreciate it\r\nif you voluntarily remove the tile-downloading programs from your web\r\nsite. The programs violate the Maps Terms of Service available at\r\nhttp://www.google.com/help/terms_local.html, and jeopardize our\r\nability to make Google Maps available to the public because they\r\nencourage mass downloading of our copyrighted images and data.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in legally developing with Google Maps, check\r\nout our new Google Maps API at http://www.google.com/apis/maps/.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns, or if we have contacted the\r\nwrong person, please feel free to contact me directly.  Otherwise,\r\nplease let us know as soon as possible when the service has been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n[Private]\r\nProduct Manager, Google Maps","date_sent":"2005-07-07T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-07-07T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Copyright and Fair Use"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Law Offices of Brian Schneider","recipient_name":"MIT","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
