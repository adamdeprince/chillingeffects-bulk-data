It is complete lie and fabrication. It never  \nhappened and it is without fact.\n\nNever in our business history have we had 2 dozen people waiting or even 2\n \ndozen people at once in our office or parking station. It just does not  \nhappen and this incident was written by a party who remains anonymous and \n\nwho has only written one other report.\n\nThe person needs to be investigated.\n\nIt is a complete lie.\n\nWhat can I do to get it removed. I believe it was done by a competitor or \n\ndisgruntle person. This never happened.\n\nHow can you allow it to be and it can damage our business.\n\nCould you please have it removed or call me.\n\nPlease let me know what I need to do.\n\nregards\n\nRussell Hatton\n\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://maps.google.com.au/maps/user?uid=204223590661745206946&hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ved=0CEUQhQo&sa=X&ei=QweNT-HVG4OPmQWUp7SPDQ"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
