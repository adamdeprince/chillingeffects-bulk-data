After designing of the dresses and apparel to be sold by us,\r\ncause photographic images of such products to be created for the\r\npurposes of publicity by way of catalogues and on our website etc. The\r\ndress designs created by us and the photographic images of such products\r\nare the exclusive property of Kaneesha Boutique Inc USA, Kaneesha\r\nBoutique India and Kaneesha.com to be utilized by us alone, unless we\r\nhave expressly licensed others to so utilize them. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe own web site Kaneesha.com since 2001 and display the dresses designed\r\nby us on this web site. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe were shocked to find that many of the designs solely and originally\r\ncreated by us and shown on our website, Kaneesha.com for publicity and\r\nas an online catalogue, have been illegally copied and used by India\r\nFashion House, Inderjeet Singh, 50  moti bazar dehradun, Dehradun,\r\nHimachal Pradesh,248001, INDIA, on their website\r\nindiafashionboutique.com, thereby misrepresenting people into believing\r\nthat the same have been designed by indiafashionboutique.com. and\r\ndisplayed at www.indiafashionboutique.com\r\n<http://www.indiafashionboutique.com/> ,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/show_product.php?hid=13&id=24&naam=C\r\nhuridar%20Suits,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/show_product.php?hid=13&id=25&naam=E\r\nmbriodered%20Suits,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/show_product.php?hid=13&id=26&naam=E\r\nast%20West%20Suits,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/subcat.php?hid=12&naam=Sarees%20/%20\r\nCholis%20Skirts,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/show_product_full.php?id=23&hid=12&n\r\naam=Lengha%20-%20Cholis,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/subcat.php?hid=14&naam=Jewellery,\r\nhttp://www.indiafashionboutique.com/subcat.php?hid=15&naam=Accessories.\r\nWe were further shocked to find that indiafashionboutique.com have used\r\nthe designs originally created by us. They have also caused the images\r\nto be displayed through indiafashionboutique.com, thereby passing off\r\nand/or attempting to pass off the said designs as if they had been\r\ncreated by indiafashionboutique.com. Please note that this misleading\r\naction has caused great loss and harm to our name and reputation in the\r\ninternational market, as most of the designs created by us and displayed\r\non our web site have been reproduced by indiafashionboutique.com. Do\r\nfurther note that this action is a gross violation of intellectual\r\nproperty laws by indiafashionboutique.com and/or their\r\nassociates/partners as indiafashionboutique.com and those concerned with\r\nthem have attempted to pass off designs created by us as original\r\ncreations of indiafashionboutique.com. Our products sought to be shown\r\nto be as those of indiafashionboutique.com and also as appearing through\r\nyour web server are as displayed at URLs specified above (we have saved\r\ncopies of all the pages and can be produced to appropriate legal\r\nauthority as required). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis action constitutes an infringement of our exclusive right on the\r\ndresses and our design as well as photographs/images created by us for\r\nthe purpose of our exclusive use for advertising of the products. The ip\r\naddress 70.84.175.130 where the site is hosted resolves to your server\r\nTheplanet.com. Not only have indiafashionboutique.com infringed the\r\nexclusive right in respect of the above but you have also tried to pass\r\nof products designed by us as those of their own by allowing them to\r\nhost illegally downloaded images on your web server. This act in posting\r\nimages of products designed by us is a violation of our trade designs\r\noriginally created and designed by a designing team of Kaneesha.com,\r\nwhich is unique to our images.
