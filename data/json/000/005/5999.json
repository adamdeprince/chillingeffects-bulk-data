\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20041027123913/xenu.ch/images/symbole/pins.jpg \r\n\r\nDear [Private]:  \r\n\r\nAs you may recall I have written to you in the distant past on behalf of our client, Religious Technology Center (\"RTC\"), a non-profit religious corporation located in Los Angeles, California, with respect to intellectual property matters. RTC is the owner of the confidential Advanced Technology of the Scientology religion and the holder of exclusive rights under the copyrights applicable to the Advanced Technology materials. The Advanced Technology materials are confidential, unpublished, copyrighted works which include, among others, the individual works comprising levels known as \"OT II,\" \"OT III,\" \"NOTs,\" \"Class VIII Assists lecture\" and \"Power.\" These works are registered with the United States Copyright Office under registration numbers: TXu 257-326; TXu 303-388; TXu 290-496; TXu 593-514; and TXu 303-386. RTC is also the owner to the trade and service marks of the Scientology religion.\r\n  \r\nOur office also represents Bridge Publications, Inc. (\"BPI\"), exclusive licensee of the copyrights to the published works of the Scientology religion, which includes numerous books and tapes and tape transcripts.  \r\n\r\nWe have been advised that there are a substantial number of our clients' copyrighted works contained in your archive. Because of the volume of infringements, the URLs where these can be found are attached to this notice.  Copies of our client's copyrighted works in your archive violates United States copyright law. Accordingly, we ask for your help in removing these materials. \r\n \r\nOur clients have obtained numerous permanent injunctions concerning Internet infringements of this and similar works. In RTC v. Lerma, Case No. 95-1107-A, the court ruled in favor of RTC, permanently enjoining the defendant infringer from posting on the Internet, the same OT III work that is the subject of this letter. A jury in the United States District Court in San Jose, California assessed damages in the amount of $75,000 against a Mr. Henson for copyright znfringement, for posting another of RTC's NOTs works on the Internet. Mr. Henson was also permanently enjoined by the court against further infringements. Three other United States courts have issued permanent injunctions against Internet infringements of these and related works.  \r\n\r\nThere are also a number of RTC''s trademarks in your archive, which include the Scientology Symbol; Scientology Cross; Dianetics Symbol; Division 6 Symbol; OT Symbol; Signature of L. Ron Hubbard; Sea Org Symbol; Church of Scientology International Corporate Symbol. These are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office under the following registration numbers: 1727436; 1280999; 1296040; 1646324; 1302525; 1012452; 1325117; 0687990; 1731257; 1368281; 1318642; 1736320; 1723622; 1776443; 1777809; 1677106; 1296039; 1295115; 1296995; 1419966; 1785901; 1821751; 1334758; 1326867; 0877948; 1317343; 1534234; 2056778; 1954851; 1822667; 1158638; 1637087; and 2007708. \r\nThese trademarks are also set forth under the URLs which are attached to this notice.  \r\n\r\nThe use of these registered trademarks in this fashion has caused your name to be falsely associated with our client's registered marks as owner and creates a likelihood of confusion as to the source or sponsorship of your website in violation of United States state and federal law, including the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. ss 1125(a).\r\n  \r\nLikewise, our client''s trademarks are famous, distinctive and unique. The use of the marks in this manner dilutes and tarnishes the distinctiveness of the marks in violation of the federal trademark antidilution statute, 15 U.S.C. ss 1125(c) and California''s antidilution statute, California Bus. & Prof. Code ss 14330. See, Archdiocese of St. Louis v. Internet Entertainment Group, Inc., 34 F.Supp.2d 1145 (E.D. Mo. 1999); Mattel, Inc. v. Internet dimensions, Inc., 55 U.S.P.Q.2d 1620 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Deere & Co. v. MTD Products, Inc., 41 F.3d 39, 43 (2nd Cir. 1994); Century 21 Real Estate Corporation v. Sandlin, 846 F.2d 1175 (9th Cir. 1988); Grey v. Campbell Soup Company, 650 F.Supp. 1166 (D.C. Cal. 1986).  \r\n\r\nThe use of our client''s marks in this manner also constitutes an unlawful false designation of origin and as such, violates ss 43(a) of the Lanham Trade-Mark Act. This prohibits any use of another''s trademarks that is \"likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or  association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person.\" America Online, Inc. v. IMS, 24 F.Supp.2d 548, 551 (E.D.Va. 1998). See also, OBH, Inc. v. Spotlight Magazine, Inc., 86 F.Supp.2d 176 (W.D. New York 2000); (trademark infringement and trademark dilution found against infringer for use of registered trademark to divert Internet users to his web site); In accord, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals v. Doughney, 263 F.3d 359 (4th Cir. 2001).
