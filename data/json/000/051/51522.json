You can see it at design-milk.com. Many people post our RSS feed, but this particular website, TheMagazine.us is using our content, photos as well as original text, and republishing it on their website and claiming it as their own. They are re-uploading photos and stripping our RSS footer (which has a copyright line). This can damage our search results, therefore we hope that you can consider removing their site from search. \r\n\r\nExample A: \r\nDesign Milk original content: http://design-milk.com/friday-five-with-jacob-granat/\r\nTheMagazine.us copied content: http://themagazine.us/art/friday-five-with-jacob-granat/\r\n\r\nExample B:\r\nDesign Milk original content: http://design-milk.com/dog-milk-best-of-july-2012/\r\nTheMagazine.us copied content: http://themagazine.us/art/dog-milk-best-of-july-2012/\r\n\r\nPractically the entire Art & Design category of themagazine.us is copied directly from Design Milk:\r\nhttp://themagazine.us/category/art/","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://themagazine.us/category/art/"},{"url":"http://www.themagazine.us/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://themagazine.us/category/art/"},{"url":"http://themagazine.us"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
