If no action has been taken we reiterate our request for your immediate assistance and ask that you inform the site operator(s) of the illegality of their conduct.\r\n\r\nWe note that under Google's Blogger DMCA Policy, Google will, in appropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of repeat infringers and that under the Blogger Content Policy Google reserves the right to terminate accounts that are used for unlawful purposes.\r\n\r\nOur top priority is to prevent the continued availability of the IFPI Represented Companies' content on the internet. Unauthorized copies of sound recordings that are freely available, especially pre-release recordings, cause substantial damage to the IFPI Represented Companies every hour and day they remain available. In sending these notices, we are seeking to ensure that infringing content is removed from the internet as quickly as possible through your cooperation. However, please note that we do not admit that we or the IFPI Represented Companies are responsible for detecting infringing material and notifying you of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also do not admit that you are within the protection of the DMCA safe harbors or that prompt removal of links according to this notice is sufficient for you to avoid potential liability under applicable copyright laws, though it may mitigate your exposure.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that operator(s) of the above site(s) may be liable for infringing activity occurring on your service. In addition, your company may also be liable for any resulting infringement. This notice does not constitute a waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at IFPI Secretariat, [redacted], London W1J 0DD, United Kingdom or email [redacted]@ifpi.org, to discuss this notice.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have submitted a signature to be placed on file with Google.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\n\r\n[redacted]\r\nVice-President, Internet Anti-Piracy\r\nIFPI\r\n[redacted]\r\nLondon\r\nW1J 0DD\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nEmail: [redacted]@ifpi.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2008-05-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-05-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Head of Internet Anti-Piracy","principal_name":"IFPI","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.
