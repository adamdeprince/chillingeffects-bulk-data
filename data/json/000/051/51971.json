Here is a portion of my original content:\r\n\r\nIf achieving a positive attitude was all it took to have everything you want in life, would you do what it takes to make it happen?\r\nWould you take the time to train your mind towards positive thoughts? I\u2019m sure you would! Self hypnosis is one of the easiest ways to do so.\r\n\u201cIs the glass half full or is the glass half empty?\u201d\r\nYour answer to the question gives away what kind of outlook on like you have.\r\nThere is no denying that tough things can and do happen in your life. Sandy was facing bankruptcy and foreclosure which are both really tough things to face. She had been trying to keep it all together and finally she could deny it no longer.\r\nThis could have gone either of two ways.\r\n\r\nSandy could have stayed in bed each morning bemoaning the choices she made that led her down this wrotten path. She could have blamed the government, her family and her luck\u2026 anyone but herself.\r\nOr she could think positive thoughts.\r\nRealizing that things could actually have been worse, she could choose to look at the bright side of things. She didn\u2019t deny that things were bad. Instead, she chose to use positive self talk to remind herself of the good things in life. She reminded herself that she was healthy and she would get over this.\r\nYour life will change for the better with a positive attitude.\r\nWhatever it is that you are going through in your life, you will get over it or through it much easier with positive thoughts. It\u2019s not about putting your head in the sand and pretending things are good. It is about focusing on the positive aspects of any situation. There is always something positive to be found if you look for it.\r\nThink about it for a moment, aren\u2019t you naturally drawn to people with a positive attitude? I know that I am. I also see the difference in the way people treat me when I am feeling positive rather than when I am not feeling so good.\r\nAchieving a positive attitude is easier than you think. You can do this too.\r\nThis \u2018Positive Attitude\u2019 self hypnosis download (also available as a CD) makes it easy for you to change your mindset into the kind of positive self talk that will turn your attitude upside down.\r\nYour outlook on life will change all the way down to the core of your subconscious mind. You\u2019ll be be better equipped to recognize and take advantage of opportunities that show up on your door. Others will notice that you feel better about yourself.\r\nIt is so simple to use a self hypnosis audio. All you do is:\r\n\r\nFind a quiet place where you won\u2019t be disturbed for a half hour\r\nClose your eyes, listen and relax.\r\n\r\nYou can listen as often as you feel you need to. It\u2019s even ok if you fall asleep while you are listening.\r\nI think the best answer is that the glass is always full. When you thinkg about it, you realize the glass is filled half with water and half with air.\r\nThat\u2019s the way Sandy decided to look at it.\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\np.s. Here\u2019s where you start achieving a Positive Attitude formatted in either a cd or mp3.

You might end up with the pain of a tension headache or even worse, a migraine.\r\nPain from a backache can worsen to the point where you have to take a few days off work just to take care of yourself. It ususally happens when you can least afford to.\r\nEveryday Hassles Cause the Most Stress\r\nIt turns out that it isn\u2019t usually the big life events that cause the most stress. It is the everyday hassles that come and go naturally.\r\nYou wake up and realize that your alarm clock didn\u2019t work and you are going to be late for your flight. As you rush to get ready, you spill coffee on your clothes. When you finally get into the car, you realize that you are almost out of gas because your teenage daughter didn\u2019t fill the tank. (My kids ALWAYS leave the tank empty for me :)\r\nYou \u2018grin and bear it\u2019 by attributing it to your busy way of life.\r\nThe stress builds to the point where it has become a chronic condition and you actually become used to it. Or so you think.\r\nTruth is, your body needs a little relief from all this stress on a regular basis. Your body needs a chance to recover before the next onslaught of stress. You will be better able to handle what life brings your way.\r\nBest Stress Reducers to Use Everyday\r\nWhen you incorporate a little bit of stress reduction into your daily life, you will recover much quicker when you face a stressful situation.\r\n\r\nMusic\r\nOne of the best ways to calm your nerves is to listen to relaxing music. This is something you can do almost any time or place.\r\nSelf Hypnosis / Meditation\r\nSelf hypnosis is a proven method used for many things and dealing with stress is one of them. Meditation is very similar to self hypnosis but there is one big difference.\r\nWith meditation, you are emptying and clearing your mind of cluttered thoughts. With self hypnosis, you are filling your mind up with thoughts and ideas that will directly make an impact on your goals.\r\nIf your goal is to relax and reduce stress, then self hypnosis will easily help you.\r\nLaughter\r\nThere is a reason that clowns roam hospital halls cheering up sick children. it is because laughter reduces stress. Bring some laughter into your life by watching a funny movie, read the comics or telling a joke. When you can laugh at the things that have gone wrong, it will lighten your spirit and lessen the tension you may be feeling.\r\nThe best stress reducers are the ones that are the easiest to use, aren\u2019t they?\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\np.s.

Disgusted with himself for the mess he made, he looked around the mostly empty restaurant until our eyes met. He gave me a sheepish grin and offered up his explanation before going in search of someone to clean it up for him.\r\nI imagined that this wasn\u2019t the first thing that had gone wrong today. He had probably overslept because he had forgotten to set the alarm the night before. After getting dressed in a hurry (the mismatched socks were a giveaway), he went to his car and it wouldn\u2019t start. He tried to call for help but his cell phone battery died and he doesn\u2019t have a house phone any more.\r\nHe finally gets a break from work, goes out for a quick lunch and\u2026 spills his drink.\r\nHave you ever had one of those days where everything just seems to go wrong?\r\nIt isn\u2019t the major life events that cause us the most stress.\r\nIt is the buildup of little things that happen throughout the day. You are constantly bombarded with stressors all day long. You are overloaded with too many things to do. There is too much noise around you.\r\n\r\nWithout relief, this kind of stress takes a toll on your health. It can lead to headaches, backaches, digestive problems and even heart disease. You might even find yourself having angry outbursts. Ever wonder why road rage is on the rise?\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\r\nWhatever you\u2019ve been doing to manage your stress hasn\u2019t been working.\r\nIf stress leads you to overeat, then you just end up gaining weight. If you relieve your stress by going on a shopping spree, you end up with empty pockets. You know that smoking, drinking and meds don\u2019t work in the long run either\u2026 right?\r\nSelf hypnosis is an easy way to use your body\u2019s natural relaxation response to remove stress instantly.\r\nWhen you practice stress management on a regular basis:\r\n\r\nYou are much more likely to recover from the daily bombardment of tension.\r\nYou will take a more relaxed approach to life.\r\nYou\u2019ll respond differently to daily situations as they arise so that stress doesn\u2019t build up.\r\n\r\nSelf hypnosis allows you to life the weight of stress from your shoulders and that means you\u2019ll avoid the buildup of future tension.\r\nGet started using self hypnosis for stress relief right here.\r\nI nodded to the man in the red shirt and agreed with him that they should have put the lid on tighter.

Have a Goal Buddy\r\nThis works on the good old fashioned principle of friendly competition. Nobody wants to give in and admit their friend is more motivated, so you have an incentive to get off the couch and practice. It may not be the purest of motives, but it works. Improving at any skill is all about learning what\u2019s effective.\r\n\r\n2. Understand Peaks and Plateaus\r\nThere will be times when you slug away for weeks or months on end without feeling like you\u2019re improving. Some people decide to give up at this point \u2013 these are the people who don\u2019t understand how acquiring a new skill works.\r\nLearning is never a steady upward slope. Acquiring a skill consists of a quick burst of improvement, followed by a relatively long plateau. You have to get used to that plateau. While it may appear on the surface that you\u2019re not improving, the plateau is when you consolidate your skill gains and lay the groundwork for the next big leap in improvement.\r\n3. Form a Routine\r\nIt may be the case that your work life doesn\u2019t allow for much practice, but the fact is most people can rearrange their weekly schedule to make room for golf practice if they really care about getting good. Often saying you have no time is simply an avoidance mechanism and an excuse so you don\u2019t have to make an honest effort to improve. If you\u2019re used to being mediocre at everything, your mind starts to convince you that\u2019s the way it should be. It then becomes very hard to excel at a sport.\r\n\r\nCommit to a practice routine for at least one day a week. The improvements will accumulate over time if you stay consistent.\r\n4. Reward Yourself\r\nMake an arrangement with yourself to give yourself a small reward after every practice. This gives you some motivation to get through the hard work, because you know there\u2019s something good at the end of it.\r\nAlternatively, combine this with Tip 1 and have a mutual reward system going between you and your friend \u2013 for example, you pay him $10 if you don\u2019t show up to practice. This makes it harder to get off the hook.\r\n5. Use Hypnosis for Motivation\r\nHypnosis for motivation is a powerful tool. Hypnosis is a quick way to alter deeply entrenched thought patterns without a lot of slow, difficult self-development work. You can learn to hypnotize yourself or look into sessions with a professional hypnotist in order to remove bad habits like procrastination.\r\nWhen you follow these self motivation tips, your game of golf will improve.\r\nYou might also enjoy these related articles:\r\n\r\nShare your thoughts with us!\r\nWe want to hear what you are thinking!","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hopehypnotherapy.com/hypnosis-tips/self-motivation-tips-to-be-a-better-golfer/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hypnosis-self-help.com/self-motivation-tips-for-golfers.html"}]},{"description":"Every time I post new content on my blog, it is copied to the infringing website and linked back to my own content which gives me spammy link for my own original content which was copied.

If you like to smoke as soon as you get in your car\u2026that\u2019s a trigger. Or maybe you want a cigarette when you have a cup of coffee. You might even think smoking is relaxing. Physically it does not relax you. You know what IS relaxing?\r\nSelf hypnosis is relaxing.\r\nIf you are not sure what it feels like, I\u2019ll tell you.\r\nIt feels like when you are laying in bed in the morning and you are not quite asleep and yet you are not quite awake either. You are sort of in between. It feels so good.\r\nWhile you are in this deep state of relaxing trance, your mind will more easily accept the suggestions that will help you to stop smoking.\r\nIt\u2019s that easy.\r\nYou will stop reaching for cigarettes.\r\nAre you ready?\r\nSee more great Stop Smoking By Hypnosis mp3\u2032s, cd\u2019s and books.\r\nShop safe at Amazon and enjoy free shipping if you spend $25 or more.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hopehypnotherapy.com/hypnosis-tips/hypnosteps-stop-smoking-for-life-guided-hypnosis-nlp/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hypnosis-self-help.com/stop-smoking-by-hypnosis-hypnosteps-stop-smoking-for-life-guided-hypnosis-nlp-cd.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
