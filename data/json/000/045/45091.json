{"dmca":{"id":45091,"type":"Dmca","title":"Subpoena Report","body":"Internet service: OIT of Georgia Tech. I have until Jan 4 to respond and I am not sure how. Ive been trying to contact some lawyers. They respond initially, but seem to lose interest for unknown reasons. If someone can please advise me without forcing me to scrap together $200-$300 for just a conversation, please respond to me. THANK YOU. \r\n\r\nI feel framed because I never ever use my school server to DL/UL, but RIAA sent me evidence saying otherwise and I do not know what to do. I never got a warning email from my ISP previous to this letter; I got the email on the 17th, 12 days after the letter was sent. This seems pretty fair doesn't it? I can forward that email to you guys too if you want. And what I find most unfair is, my \"peers\" who actively dl/ul only get hit with this warning from OIT whereas I got dropped the real deal straight from RIAA when I take preventative measures to not DL/UL at all on school servers. How lucky. If anyone can give me some suggestions, please respond to me. I ask for your sympathy because I feel framed and worrysome about this during my Holiday break, and this is how I have to start my next semester, with a $3000 debt to a rich company. My grades aren't that great at Tech and I have to somehow find a way to balance between grades and paying off jerks who found a way to abuse the legal system and attack poor college students. Thank you very much for your time. Have a Happy New Years!\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\nDina","date_sent":"2007-12-05T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-12-05T05:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Holme Roberts and Owen LLP","principal_name":"RIAA","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
