Mrs. Slavicek\r\n\r\n> has been the victim of numerous instances of copyright infringement at\r\n\r\n> numerous websites, and we have diligently tracked down and removed all\r\n\r\n> such infringements.  Currently, the phrase \"Kimberly Slavicek \r\n> scottsdale\" is returned as search term results for two web pages:\r\n> <http://www.w3hooker.com/3/Minsk+Brides.html>\r\n> www.w3hooker.com/3/Minsk+Brides.html and \r\n> <http://www.w3massage.com/3/Erotic+Massages.html>\r\n> www.w3massage.com/3/Erotic+Massages.html, which currently reside on \r\n> your server.  We feel strongly that copyright infringement is \r\n> occurring in connection with Mrs. Slavicek's name; however, due to the\r\n\r\n> fact that there is a rotating script and the web pages are constantly \r\n> redirected to different websites, we are unable to pinpoint the actual\r\n\r\n> infringement.  We have contacted the webmaster of the web pages, \r\n> Phuket Hosting Services, and they remain uncooperative.  Mrs. Slavicek\r\n\r\n> is eager to distance herself from these websites, and we kindly \r\n> request that you disable the web pages located at \r\n> <http://www.w3hooker.com/3/Minsk+Brides.html>\r\n> www.w3hooker.com/3/Minsk+Brides.html and \r\n> <http://www.w3massage.com/3/Erotic+Massages.html>\r\n> www.w3massage.com/3/Erotic+Massages.html.  Your assistance with this \r\n> matter\r\n> is greatly appreciated.   \r\n>  \r\n>   \r\n>  \r\n> Should you have any questions, please me at (415) 955-1155 x115, or at\r\n\r\n> matt@kronenbergerlaw.com.   \r\n>  \r\n>   \r\n>  \r\n> Thank you. \r\n>  \r\n>   \r\n>  \r\n> Sincerely,\r\n>  \r\n> Matt Thomson\r\n>  \r\n>   \r\n>  \r\n>   \r\n>  \r\n> Matthew M.
