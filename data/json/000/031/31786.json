I believe this goes against your Copyright policy,\r\nand I do have emails from various composers stating that they gave no\r\npermission to this website for hosting their music. They have admitted\r\nthemselves that they are pirating these Original Soundtracks. Can you please\r\ndo something about this, as these composers and companies do not like having\r\npirated goods up for grabs?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nHarry\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nNew year, new job - there's more than 100,00 jobs at SEEK\r\nhttp://a.ninemsn.com.au/b.aspx?URL=http%3A%2F%2Fninemsn%2Eseek%2Ecom%2Eau&_t\r\n=752315885&_r=Jan05_tagline&_m=EXT\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-03-05T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-03-05T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Harry","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
