In\r\nparticular Partition Magic 8.0, CuteFTP, Photoshop CS, and Microsoft Visual\r\nBasic 6.0. The direct links for these downloads are as follows:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fucking-yahoo.com/programs/drugs/Visual%20Basic%206.zip\r\nhttp://www.fucking-yahoo.com/programs/drugs/Partition%20Magic%208.0%20Pro.zi\r\np\r\nhttp://www.fucking-yahoo.com/programs/drugs/CuteFTP%20Professional%207.zip\r\nhttp://www.fucking-yahoo.com/programs/drugs/Photoshop%20CS%202.zip\r\n\r\nSince you blatantly disregarded my previous email concerning this piracy I\r\nhave sent emails to the companies that own the intellectual property in\r\nquestion as well. Perhaps in the future you will investigate such complaints\r\nrather than ignore them.\r\n\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
