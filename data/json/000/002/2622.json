He was told by the trustees in Glastonbury They wanted absolutely nothing to do with him.\r\n\r\nHe then went ahead and put the Winds Of Truth on Yahoo, he changed text and added His own material. This is total abuse off our copyright for the Winds Of Truth.\r\n\r\nThe trustees then put a case forward to Yahoo And they removed the infringing sites, we are now aware he has them back on again and also on Google. The Trustees want this material involving all Winds of Truth books removed from all his sites.
