They mention me by name (and slice up my\r\n\r\ncontent to the point where it's almost nonsensical).  I do not want my  \r\nname associated with this site, and I did not give authorization for  \r\nthis content to be used in this manner. \r\n \r\nhttp://marketingparadise.com/info/direct-tv-satellite-internet/3186/ \r\nhttp://marketingparadise.com/info/direct-tv-satellite-internet/ \r\n \r\n \r\nI assume that the entire domain is a violation of your terms of service\r\n\r\n(it's clearly being set up as an ad-farm, splog, or other worthless  \r\nsite, and is currently churning along with other people's content in an\r\n\r\neffort to raise page rank).  Please shut it down. \r\n \r\nIn the event that the site itself isn't a violation of your terms,  \r\nplease let me know.
