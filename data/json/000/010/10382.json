CROSS complains of blog copying","body":"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nI wish to complain about a blogger who is using my copyrighted material without permission. The infringing material is contained on the blog \"Nobody Notes\" http://fafani.blogspot.com/2005_10_09_fafani_archive.html. Since this person does not have a permalink or date stamp on their post, I have enclosed printouts from the infringing post. You will notice that it bears my own copyright notice, as well as forbidding the unauthorized re-use of my materials.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. Furthermore, I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nI ask that you delete this page from the blog, and prevent this blogger from posting any additional copyrighted material from my site or any other.\r\n \r\n ","date_sent":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"W.
