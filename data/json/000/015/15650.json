Google previously assigned a case number of 64941780 to Wiley's original request of July 14, 2006.\r\n\r\nWhile the decision is solely Google's, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. respectfully suggests that this seller be permanently suspended from Google Groups, in light of their willful and repeated infringement of our intellectual property.\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to claim any damages accruing to Wiley as a result of Google's failure to suspend this individual, despite Wiley's repeated notifications to Google of the individual's infringement of its intellectual property.\r\n\r\nThe material is as follows:\r\n\r\n1.
