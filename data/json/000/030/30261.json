I know from experience what an impact divorce can have on a  \nwoman\u2019s life.\n\nWhen I went through my divorce, I was emotionally raw, worn down by all the  \ndecisions to be made, and frustrated by the lack of good information.\n\nConsequently, I made my fair share of mistakes.  Having learned my lessons  \nthe hard way, I made a promise to myself that no woman would ever have to  \nface this journey alone. As a result, I started the WomansDivorce website  \nin 2001 to help other women going through a divorce, and have done so ever  \nsince.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://womandivorce.blogspot.com/2012/01/blog-post.html"},{"url":"http://womandivorce.blogspot.com/2012/01/do-you-need-divorce-advice.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.womansdivorce.com/index.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
