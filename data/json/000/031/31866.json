As we hope you can appreciate,\r\nClassmates Online is concerned that your unauthorized use of the CLASSMATES\r\nregistered trademark on your site and in your domain name may cause\r\nconfusion as to whether you or your company's activities are authorized,\r\nendorsed or sponsored by Classmates Online when, in fact, they are not. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, your website includes the following phrase \"Leap through a\r\nportal to the best of your past. Rediscover the people, places, and pop\r\nculture of your youth\" on its homepage. Classmates Online uses this phrase\r\nextensively in its advertising and gained copyright protection for this\r\nphrase in 2001, Copyright Reg No. TX 5-508-975. \r\n\r\nInternational and US federal laws protect against the unauthorized use,\r\nsale, or offering for sale a domain name which infringes another's\r\ntrademark. Infringers who have been notified of such infringing activity,\r\nbut do not cease their infringements, may also be considered \"willful\" and\r\ncould be subject to monetary damages. Having received this e-mail, you are\r\non such notice. \r\n\r\nWhile we understand that you may have registered the above domain name and\r\ndeveloped the FindLostClassmate.com website without full knowledge of the\r\nlaw in this area and Classmates Online respects your right of expression and\r\nyour desire to conduct business on the Internet, we must enforce our own\r\nrights in order to protect our valuable and famous trademark(s).
