You must remove all files, not just one of\r\nthe HTML pages that link to them.\r\n\r\nThe files in question seem to all be in these directories:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.123mycodes.com/myspacecursors/file/\r\nhttp://www.123mycodes.com/myspacecursors/preview/\r\n\r\nI will await you further action and response.\r\n\r\nAlso, how many more times does your client get to just re-upload the\r\nsame files before you just shut down their account?\r\n\r\n\r\nShannon Hicks\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Everyones Internet DMCA Agent [mailto:dmca@ev1.net]\r\nSent: Wednesday, October 04, 2006 3:40 PM\r\nTo: shan@iotashan.com\r\nSubject: Abuse complaint regarding the server located at [209.85.53.162]\r\n123mycodes.com Case Number: 10025\r\n\r\nYour Reference Number: 123mycodes.com\r\nOur Case Number: 10025\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, \r\n\r\nWe feel that the user in question in this violation has successfully\r\nremoved the material in question regarding the abuse complaint and have\r\nclosed the case in our records, as of 10/4/2006 3:39:34 PM. \r\n\r\nThe offending URL(S) was:  http://www.123mycodes.com/custom-cursor.php.\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact us at chrisn@ev1servers.net\r\nand\r\nabuse@ev1servers.net.
