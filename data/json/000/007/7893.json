The bespoke desk takes styling cues from the Bugatti Grand Prix racing cars of the late \u201820s and early \u201830s. Details taken from the design of the cars were used in different forms or scales within the design. The drive gears for the height adjustment are a scaled-up version of the Winfield carburetor synchronization quadrants from a Type 57, and the drawer fronts reflect the honeycombed grill.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://carsbitblogsport.blogspot.com/2011/05/bugatti-grand-prix-racing-car-inspired.html"},{"url":"http://lux.chariweb.com/2011/05/bugatti-grand-prix-racing-cars-inspired.html"},{"url":"http://topgearnew.blogspot.com/2011/05/bugatti-grand-prix-racing-car-inspired.html"},{"url":"http://www.azdnet.com/2011/05/we-have-seen-range-of-automobile-themed.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.bornrich.com/entry/bugatti-grand-prix-racing-cars-inspired-desk-for-auto-lovers/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
