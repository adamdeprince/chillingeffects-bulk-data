As we hadnt heard from   \r\nyou we have instructed US lawyers to act and they now tell us they   \r\nhave sufficient corporate information to instigate proceedings against\r\n\r\nyou, which will now include a substantial damages claim. This is your   \r\nlast chance to respond positively and avoid this course of action. Wae\r\n\r\nawait such confirmation from you by return. \r\n \r\nyours faithfully \r\n \r\nColin Barr\r\nHeathcrest Legal Consultants \r\n \r\n \r\nDear Sirs \r\n \r\nRE: DUBAI FORUMS \r\n \r\nWe write to you on behalf of deVere & Partners / PIC in respect of\r\npostings over a number of weeks on your postings site relating to PIC\r\nand deVere. \r\n \r\nAlthough deVere & Partners / PIC are a Global Company it is owned by\r\nBritish Nationals.  We understand you are located in the USA and subject\r\ntherefore to USA law. We are putting you on notice that unless you deal\r\nwith the matters listed below and remove ALL postings and keep such\r\npostings off your web site, we will seek to take action against you in\r\nthe USA for damages in respect of loss of reputation from falsehoods and\r\naccusations in these postings leading to a clear loss of business and\r\nprofits. \r\n \r\n1. It started with a posting on 4th March 2005 3.34pm and the thread\r\ncontinued until May 2006. \r\n \r\n2.  The postings bring into question our independence.  We are\r\nindependent and are fully regulated by the UAE Central Bank (which you\r\ncan easily check on the UAE Central Bank website). \r\n \r\n3. The postings clearly accuse PIC/deVere of illegal acts, not being\r\nindependent etc.  All are untrue and are libelous. \r\n \r\n4. The threads also refer towards the end to such threads being removed\r\nfrom ?Expatica site?, Wall Street Dex etc.  This is because it is the\r\nsame disgruntled person using any site he/she can access to libel the\r\nCompany.  These other sites have seen this and have agreed to remove the\r\nthread.  We assume you will agree under these circumstances to remove\r\nthe thread.  If such agreement is not forthcoming, we will as said have\r\nno alternative but to seek to take action against you in the USA for\r\ndamages but will also seek to have your site barred in the UAE due to\r\nits libelous content. \r\n \r\n5. We are sure you agree that if anybody genuinely had such complaints\r\nthey should be made to the appropriate authority of the country in which\r\nthey reside or in which they conducted business with deVere/PIC. \r\n    It may be of interest to you that no such action has been taken\r\nanywhere in Dubai or anywhere else we trade. \r\n \r\nYour response is awaited within the next 7 days. \r\n \r\nYours faithfully\r\nColin Barr\r\nHead Legal Consultant\r\nHeathcrest Legal Consultants Ltd\r\nPS.
