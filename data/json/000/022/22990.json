(RIAA) and its member record companies.  The RIAA is a trade\r\nassociation whose member companies create, manufacture and distribute\r\napproximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound recordings sold in\r\nthe United States.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the RIAA is\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of its member companies in matters involving the\r\ninfringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights\r\nand common law rights on the Internet.   \r\n\r\nWe believe your service is hosting the above-referenced files on its\r\nnetwork.  These files offer sound recordings for download by the artist\r\nknown as Coldplay, which have not yet been commercially released.  We have a\r\ngood faith belief that the above-described activity is not authorized by the\r\ncopyright owner, its agent, or the law.  We assert that the information in\r\nthis notification is accurate, based upon the data available to us.   \r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing file from\r\nthe system, or that you disable access to the infringing file, and that you\r\ninform the site operator of the illegality of his or her conduct. \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice.  In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement. This letter does not constitute a waiver of any\r\nright to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized\r\nactivities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly\r\nretained. \r\n\r\nYou may contact me at RIAA, 1330 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 300,\r\nWashington, D.C., 20036, Tel. (202) 775-0101, or e-mail antipiracy@riaa.com,\r\nto discuss this notice.  We await your response.  Kind regards. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nJeremy Landis \r\nOnline Copyright Protection  \r\nRIAA \r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-05-31T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-31T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"RIAA","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
