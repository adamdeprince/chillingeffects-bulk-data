We are a legitimate company headquartered at 6390 Hedgewood Drive, Suite 200, Allentown, PA 18106 and have been in business since 2002. My father Aley Raza and I started the company.\r\n\r\nI just came across a website, 3PL Service (http://3pl-service.com) that has COPIED a previous version of our entire website, replaced all instances of \"3LINX\" with \"3PL Service\" and are continuing to modify the site.\r\n\r\nE.g: \r\n- On their home page, the image they show is something our designers created.\r\n- The featured client they show \"InfoComm International\" has been a 3LINX client since 2002.\r\n- All the questions and answers on the FAQ page, I wrote personally.\r\n- The entire \"About Us\" section is a copy of our history, in most cases verbatim.\r\n- The \"Management\" page shows a father-son team. I went to Carnegie Mellon, got a degree in economics and joined Putnam Investments; yet is shows the fictitious son David Cotton doing the same.\r\n- All the clients on the \"Testimonials\" page are 3LINX clients.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://3pl-service.com/"},{"url":"http://3pl-service.com/OurStory.html"},{"url":"http://3pl-service.com/Services.html"},{"url":"http://3pl-service.com/Faqs.html"},{"url":"http://3pl-service.com/ContactUs.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://3pl-service.com"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
