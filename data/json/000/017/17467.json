As a law firm, however, we can confirm with certainty that the copyright of the picture in question vests solely with our client and that by reproducing the picture you are infringing that copyright. Our client has not authorised any such reproduction.\r\n\r\nIn respect of your policy relating to infringement of copyright, it is not our concern how you choose to deal with your copyright infringement. The fact of the matter is that you are infringing copyright that belongs to our client and we will take the necessary action to prevent this if you are not forthcoming with the removal of offending pictures.\r\n\r\nAs per-our previous emails, the picture in question shows our client in close proximity to Prince Harry. A list of URL's (as updated today), many of which are obtained from using your search engine, is set out below. This should leave no room for doubt as to the picture we refer to:\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-11-08T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-11-08T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Magrath & Co., Solicitors","principal_name":"Natalie Pinkham","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
