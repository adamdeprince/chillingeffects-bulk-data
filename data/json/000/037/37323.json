The infringement involves the publisher of \r\nthe 123Quiz.net website (Mr Will Jones) and I have been in touch with him. \r\nWhilst removing some links, he has continued to publish my work, much of \r\nwhich was never previously in the public domain. He has no authority to use \r\nmy work and, in my opinion, is in breach of UK copyright law.\r\n\r\nI am currently in the process of initiating legal action against Mr Jones, \r\nand a claim for damages, but, in the meantime, I would be grateful if you \r\nwould ensure that all material relating to Quibs, and links to any such \r\nmaterial, is removed from the sites mentioned above.\r\n\r\nYours Faithfully\r\n\r\nPeter W Styles","date_sent":"2004-11-13T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-11-13T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Quibs.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
