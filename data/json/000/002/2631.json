It was not until a rather extensive grassroots campaign undertaken by the blog community went into action that [Private] made any move to remedy the situation. Instead, he threatened me with civil action and told me to that if I wanted him to try and force him to take the material down \"try it and see what happens.\"\r\n\r\n2.\tThis is clearly a pattern of behavior. It is not a matter of a single paragraph being copied and then edited. [Private] took entire passages -- even entire posts -- and used them verbatim, alleging he was the author. There was never any credit given, not even any links to the original source material.\r\n\r\nMaybe he's now edited the material enough to make his infringement less cut and dry. I will leave that to you to decide. But, [Private] repeatedly engaged in extensive wholesale infringement and has still refused to acknowledge his behavior in any way.\r\n\r\nI hope you will take the time to look at the printed attachments that clearly show the initial infringement. I am hopeful that there is something Blogger ran do to remedy this, or to discourage [Private] from this type of behavior  If not, I understand, but hope that a record of this remains in case anyone ever files a similar complaint against [private] in the future, this will help in establishing his pattern of infringement\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n[signature]\r\n\r\n[Private] \r\nhftp://tequilamockingbird.blogspot.com\r\n\t\r\n2\r\n\r\nItem 1: \r\n1. file under \"conversations I thought I'd never have\" http://tequilamockingbird.blogspot.com/2003_07_01_tequilamockingbird_archive.html#105965922888796047\r\n\r\n2. file under \"conversations I thought I'd never have\"\r\n\r\nhttp://boywonderlives.blogspot.com/2003_12_01_boywonderlives_archive.html#107219708410804281\r\n\r\n3.
