The site in question may be found here:\r\nhttp://blogger.inmyfinger.com/blogs/christian-meet-online-woman/18585/\r\n\r\nMy original post may be found here:\r\nhttp://protectedstatic.blogspot.com/2006/04/randompolitics-atheism-and-c\r\nompassion.html\r\n\r\nI do not like seeing my work used for commercial purposes without my\r\nexplicit permission - or compensation. I'm willing to bet that there are\r\nplenty of other copyright holders who would feel the same way about\r\ntheir work being harvested so that this spam blog (splog) can boost its\r\nGoogle ratings for \"Christian meet online woman\". There is not a single\r\npiece of content on that site (that I saw) that hasn't been harvested\r\nfrom somewhere else. The entire site looks like one big copyright\r\nviolation.\r\n\r\nI honestly don't know if this customer's behavior reaches the threshold\r\nspecified by the DMCA, but I do know that I do not like seeing my\r\noriginal content used in this exploitive manner. Thank you for your\r\nattention to this matter.\r\n\r\n-- Carter Wickstrom, aka \"protected static\"\r\n   Seattle, WA\r\n   http://www.protectedstatic.com/","date_sent":"2006-05-02T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-05-02T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"http://protectedstatic.blogspot.com/2006/04/randompolitics-atheism-and-c","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
