{"dmca":{"id":492,"type":"Dmca","title":"Distorting Barbie","body":"Dear Hostmaster:\r\n\r\nI am an attorney for Mattel, Inc.\r\n\r\nAs you may know, Mattel owns the character BARBIE, as well as numerous copyright registrations for the depiction of that character.  BARBIE has been consistently marketed since at least 1959.  In connection with those copyrights, Mattel and its licensees have sold billions of dollars of merchandise.  Mattel's copyrights wlith respet to the BARBIE character are therefore extraordinarily valuable. \r\n\r\nI am writing because Mattel has recently learned that you are sponsoring the following page, on the Internet:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.users.interport.net/~napier/barbie/barbie.html\r\n\r\nThere can be no dispute that this page unlawfully infringes Mattel's copyrights.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pursuing whatever additional rights it may have under law, Mattel demands that you (i) immediately take whatever steps are necessary to remove this page from the Internet and prevent the further publication of its contents, and (ii) confirm to me in writing that you have done so within 5 business days.  \r\n\r\nWe await your response.","date_sent":"1997-10-10T04:00:00Z","date_received":"1997-10-10T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Mattel, Inc.","recipient_name":"Interport Communications","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
