He has forwarded to me a copy of your internet posting at Insiderpages.  I also have a copy of your complaint to the Board of Medical practice.  Although we believe your board complaint to be meritless, we regard that as your appropriate avenue to express any dissatisfaction with your procedure.\r\n\r\nYour insiderpages posting, on the other hand, is false, degamatory and harassing.  The posting constitutes tortious interference with the business intersts of [SENDER] and contains libelous epithets and other derogatory statements, which we will not tolerate.  These disparaging comments stand in stark contrast to your admission to the Board that the results of your surgery were \"mostly favorable\"  \r\n\r\nDemand is made for your immediate withdrawal of the posting.  If you fail to do so within 48 hours of receiving this letter, we will have no choice but to initiate legal action to remove the defamatory posting and seek damages for your action.  Please advise me by the end of the week that you have deleted the offensive posting from Insiderpages and that you will not continue to use harassing methods to express your views. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n[SENDER]","date_sent":"2007-07-10T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-07-10T04:00:00Z","topics":["Defamation","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
