I own the domain, and the accounts on Twitter, Facebook, \n\nPinterest, Technorati, and StumbleUpon, to name a few.  I came across a  \npicture of my original blog design button on Google this afternoon which  \ntook me to another blog.  After researching the code, it shows clearly\nthat  \nthe author of Fab Foodie copied my button design and saved it as her own. \n \nShe whitd out the word Find and tried unsuccessfully to add brown hair on \n\ntop of the blonde in the design.  (You can still see the blonde showing  \nthrough the edges.)  I paid a designer to design my website, and have all \n\nof our corresponding emails as proof saved.  In addition, I have contacted\n \nher, since she is the designer and let her know someone unlawfully used\nher  \ndesign that I paid her to create for me.  I have links to the coding on\nthe  \nmentioned bloggers website showing the button information was MINE, which \n\nmean is was taken without permission and pawned off as her own.  I have  \nworked with over 100 companies nationwide as Fab Find Foodie.  I have also\n \ncompeted in cooking competitions as Fab Find Foodie.  From what I saw, her\n \nblog was created in 2011, mine was 2010.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.deniseburroughs.com/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.fabfindfoodie.com"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
