We have been trying to take action\r\nagainst this site for some time as it is breaking the copyright of two\r\nof our clients. We have provided a large amount of evidence that the\r\nsite is offering illegal streams of cricket. I include screenshots that\r\nmakes it absolutely clear that this is the case. In one of the\r\nscreenshots the site owner says \"WE TELECAST TODAY PAK VS WI\". \r\n\r\nOne of our clients, Echostar Satellite L.L.C, are being infringed by the\r\nsite offering illegal streams of the Pakistan v West Indies Series. I\r\nfeel I must warn you that Echostar are currently looking to prosecute\r\nerrant ISPs, and a failure to cooperate over this issue will leave us\r\nwith little choice but to recommend ThePlanet as a potential candidate\r\nfor such action. This is not a course of action that we wish to take, as\r\nNetResult has enjoyed a good relationship with ThePlanet in the past.\r\n\r\nPlease take action against this site as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Kiernan\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Copyright [mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com]\r\nSent: 30 November 2006 18:25\r\nTo: mikek@nr-online.com\r\nCc: Theplanet@chillingeffects.org\r\nSubject: FW: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\n\r\n To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThe URL in question is currently not accessible as of 12:26:22 p.m.\r\n(GMT-6) on November 30, 2006 because it requires proprietary log-in\r\ninformation to access it.\r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\nThe Planet\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuse@ev1.net [mailto:abuse@ev1.net] Posted At: Wednesday,\r\nNovember 29, 2006 5:16 AM Posted To: DMCA\r\nConversation: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\nSubject: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n1.
