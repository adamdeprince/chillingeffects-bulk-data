At no time in \n\nour business history have we left 2 dozen people waiting for any bus.\n\nIt is a complete lie and falsehood.\n\nPeople read this and it is hurting our business. We have had one customer \n\nextort us for $1,400. I believ it is either this same customer or a  \ncompetitor.\n\nThis event did not happen and never have we had 2 dozen people wait.\n\nCan you please give me the details of this person or remove the post.\n\nI have to take legal action as its damaging to our business.\n\nPlease can you help. Our business is suffering and may go broke as our  \nbookings have dropped dramatically. This is a total lie.\n\nregards\n\nRussell Hatton\n\n\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://maps.google.com.au/maps/user?uid=204223590661745206946&hl=en-AU&gl=AU&ved=0CEUQhQo&sa=X&ei=4NiIT7zRAcyekgWrnIGrDA"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
