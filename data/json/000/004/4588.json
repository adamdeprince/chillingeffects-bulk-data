Dhanish's copying was so blatant that it failed to delete the SilverSource mark from that text (for comparison purposes, attached herewith please find a December 1, 2004 printout from the Dhanish.com website). In response to letters sent from our attorneys, Dhanish has continued to retain all of the stolen text in its entirety, but has now merely substituted all instances of the SilverSource brand name with its own.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nThis is the best available owner/administrator contact information we have for Dhanish.com, according to its WHOIS registration:\r\n\r\n[Private] \r\n[Private]\r\nBangkok 10100 Thailand\r\n\r\nWe would greatly appreciate your early attention to this matter. Please consider me personally at your service if I may provide you any further assistance or information whatsoever.
