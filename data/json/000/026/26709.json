The harassment has still not yet stopped. I would\r\nlike to know if there is a ticket number or some other number or agent\r\nassigned to my request so that I may have it for my records. I've been\r\nkeeping a log of all my conversations and the people i've talked to with\r\nyour company and I just would like to add it in. The email I recieved\r\nfrom you leads me to believe, and I apologize if i'm incorrect, that\r\nthere is still some form of investigation going on. Thank you for your\r\nassistance, as I plan to pursue this untill my personal information is\r\nremoved. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn 3/7/07, zzzzzz <dmca@theplanet.com> wrote: \r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPlease note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice does not\r\nsubstantially comply with the required notification elements of the\r\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of your\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our web site at\r\nwww.theplanet.com/about_us/legal_docs/ThePlanet%20Copyright%20Infringeme\r\n\r\nnt%2001%2015%2007%20FINAL.pdf \r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\nTHEPLANET.COM <http://theplanet.com/>  INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuse@ev1servers.net [mailto: abuse@ev1servers.net\r\n<mailto:abuse@ev1servers.net> ]\r\nSent: Monday, March 05, 2007 7:13 PM\r\nTo: DMCA\r\nSubject: [ThePlanetAbuse-C3348396F] Death threats and calls at 1:00am\r\n\r\n==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n1.

I have become the target of a especially angry\r\nmob \r\nof people who have been harrassing me for a while. \r\n\r\nI'll give you a little backstory.\r\n\r\nI was notified a few weeks prior that many copywritten photos were\r\nposted to\r\nthis site and I was in one of them. I sent a polite generic email to the\r\n\r\n\r\nsite's admin requesting it be removed and I never recieved a response. \r\nThis\r\nevening, I started reciving emails, phone calls, and threats from\r\nmembers of\r\nthe site and i'm starting to become rather upset. I revisited the site \r\nand\r\nhave now found a large post of personal information, my original email \r\nto\r\nthe site owner, and more photographs of myself along with various forms\r\nof\r\nharrasment and accusations of writing stories involving pedophilia and \r\nincest. I have not attempted further contact with the site admin, but as\r\n\r\nhe\r\nis taking part in the harrasment, I feel it would be unwise. I'm not\r\nsure\r\nhow someone got my phone number, but I know it is not on the internet. \r\nThis\r\nleads me to believe that someone on this site may possibly know me, and \r\nif\r\nthis is the case the death threats are being taken seriously.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what I can do to stop this, as I feel that anything done \r\nmay\r\nonly cause this to escalate, and I have never been involved with \r\nanything of\r\nthis nature before.\r\n\r\nI'm just a mature carrer tech guy who has to go to work tomorrow... and\r\nthe\r\nphone calls and continued harrasment are keeping me up and scaring my \r\ngirlfriend.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, a fair bit of what goes on on this site is\r\nbenign,\r\nwhat is happening to me now isn't... and after experiencing the standard\r\n\r\nresponse to a polite inquiry to remove a photo and looking at the site, \r\nI\r\nwould be shocked if I was the first complaint.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me as soon as possible preferably via my cell phone\r\nnumber\r\nwhich is 614-370-8592\r\n\r\nI fully expect further phone calls and harrasment through the night and \r\nam\r\non the brink of calling the Columbus PD.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what my options are and thank you so much for your\r\ntime\r\nand let me know how I might be able to get David from your support desk\r\nsome\r\nrecognition for listening to me ramble on the phone about this and being\r\nso\r\npolite and helpfull.\r\n\r\n-Stefan LaVigne\r\n\r\nMIME element (text/html)\r\n<div>Hello,</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div> \r\n<div>I just got off the phone with David at your support desk and he was\r\nvery nice and refered me over to you guys.
