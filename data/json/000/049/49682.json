(RIAA) and its member record companies.  The RIAA is a trade\r\nassociation whose member companies create, manufacture and distribute\r\napproximately eighty-five (85) percent of all legitimate sound recordings\r\nsold in the United States.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the\r\nRIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies on matters\r\ninvolving the infringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing\r\ntheir copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above web sites on your\r\nnetwork. These sites are offering direct links to files containing sound\r\nrecordings for other users to download by such artists known as Coldplay,\r\nPitbull, Neil Young, Lil Wayne, and Aerosmith.  These recordings are owned\r\nby one of our member companies and have not been authorized for this kind of\r\nuse. We have a good faith belief that the above-described activity is not\r\nauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  We assert that\r\nthe information in this notification is accurate, based upon the data\r\navailable to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.

In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement.  This letter does not constitute a waiver of any\r\nright to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized\r\nactivities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nPlease note: We have submitted a signature to be placed on file with Google.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at RIAA, [redacted], Washington, DC, 20004, Tel.
