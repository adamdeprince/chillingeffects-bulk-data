Should we\r\ndetermine that the notice is valid, we will be required by federal law\r\nto act expeditiously in removing or disabling access to the Infringing\r\nMaterials. We therefore strongly recommend that you immediately remove\r\nthe Infringing Materials. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease note that under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, you have\r\nthe right to file a \"counter-notice\" claiming that either (a) that the\r\nClaimant is wrong and that the Infringing Material is lawfully posted on\r\nthe Web Site or (b) that the Infringing Material has been misidentified.\r\nWe encourage you to review the procedures for filing a counter-notice,\r\nwhich are set forth in The Planet's copyright notification guidelines\r\nlocated at http://www.theplanet.com/about_us/legal.asp and to use this\r\nonline form at http://www.chillingeffects.org/dmca/counter512.pdf which\r\ncreates a PDF with all the required elements for counter-notification\r\nwhich you can send back to us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease note that The Planet has only passed on the validity of the\r\nClaimant's notice 17 U.S.C. Sec. 512 and has not sought to determine\r\nwhether the Infringing Materials on the Web Site do indeed infringe upon\r\nthe Claimant's intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe appreciate your cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLegal Response Team \r\n\r\nTHEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\n\r\nFrom: Barbara Davis [mailto:bdavis@netenforcers.com]\r\n\r\nSent: Monday, May 07, 2007 2:56 PM\r\n\r\nTo: Response, Legal\r\n\r\nSubject: FW: DMCA Complaint from LG Electronics for gbshopping.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThePlanet.com,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter.
