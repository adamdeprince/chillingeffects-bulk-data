Water, inc. is the owner of the Everhot R,\r\nEvercoldR, EverbrewR, EnviropureR, NavinetR and Water, inc R trademarks and\r\nassociated domain names. I have attempted to remove this infraction by\r\ndelivering two notifications of Cease and Desist to the e-mail of record\r\nhowever the domain owner refuses to remove the infraction.\r\n\r\nThe domain owner of this site is deliberately trying to cause customer\r\nconfusion by using Water, inc.'s trademarks to divert web traffic away from\r\nWater, inc's website at www.waterinc.com. This action constitutes trademark\r\ninfringement and unfair competition. I am therefore asking for your\r\nassistance in having the domain owner remove all references to Water, inc.'s\r\ntrademarks from their site. I truly appreciate your co-operation in this\r\nmatter and hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nTrademark Department\r\nWater, inc.\r\nLegal Administrator <administrator-106@legal-notification.com>\r\n[IFID:AGX81]\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFD18l2vK/XpJs6oyURAsjEAJ9x4TTu4Vx5PrQmfi3IC6PvHzu8KwCeKkWq\r\nOGnE/BPCEHbav7JmE7awIKc=\r\n=Cy+O\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Trademark Department (for Water, inc.)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
