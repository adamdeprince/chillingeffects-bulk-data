I do hope the originator is dealt with accordingly. I started\r\n Intra-Designs 4 years ago in Puyallup, WA. It is a local company that has put a lot back into the community, and it upsets me that people like this are allowed to abuse such a wonderful try to bring the art community\r\n together.\r\n\r\n It also surprises me that this insult is allowed to go through a city email listserv.\r\n\r\n I, for one, am publicly banning anything and everything by Mr. Richard Anderson and his company. I sincerely hope you do the same.\r\n\r\n Sincerely,\r\n Ty Belknap\r\n Intra-Designs, Inc.\r\n Daffodil Valley Times\r\n\r\n\r\n Live Like Nobody is Watching","date_sent":"2006-01-13T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-13T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Ty Belknap","recipient_name":"Holistic Forge Works","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
