The site  \nowner refuses to take down the attack pages. The linked pages are  \ndefamation.  Someone online got my personal information and wrote false  \nthings about me in order to make me look bad when someone searches for my \n\nname and city.  The Rip Off reports are on the first search pages of  \nGoogle. Since the owner of the website will not take the reports down, I  \nask that you would please remove them from the search index.
