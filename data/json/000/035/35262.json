I have attempted to contact the owners\r\nof the website in question, however I haven't received a reply from them and\r\nthe issue has not been dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe website in question is hallagulla.net/pitec.net.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hallagulla.net/vb3/showthread.php?t=85625\r\n\r\nThe biographical text located on that page was taken, without permission,\r\nfrom my website, tomwelling.org. Ironically the source code was copied in\r\nits entirety, so the text has been copied complete with a copyright notice\r\nthat reads \"please do not reproduce without written permission\".\r\n\r\nOf course they did exactly that.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate the complete removal of my work from that website's\r\ndatabase.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nJames Scott\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCyrJXvK/XpJs6oyURAoS1AJ9sSskMmy/20cO0EkdXcu1FKl7g6wCcDxgj\r\nZAwcjodGM0crz/e6YhgrsK4=\r\n=yh6/\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-07-03T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-07-03T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"James Scott","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
