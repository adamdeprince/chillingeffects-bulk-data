As said above every possible way of communicating with him\r\nto remove the content that isn't his are totally ignored.\r\n\r\nThe person whose work is on the site and was blocked from entering it, as\r\nwell as being ignored in his requests for his things to be removed, while I\r\ndon't have the exact username he used, he was going by the nickname\r\n\"Markie\". This should help so the site owner will know which situation you\r\nare referring to when he is contacted about this.\r\n\r\n\r\nRFC822 HEADERS:\r\nReceived: from mx02 ([172.16.214.181] helo=mx02.filter.theplanet.com)\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com with esmtps (TLSv1:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:256)\r\n        (Exim 4.50)\r\n        id 1F4w4N-0002pm-HI\r\n        for abuseadm@theplanet.com; Fri, 03 Feb 2006 02:13:27 -0600\r\nReceived: from mail.inside.theplanet.com ([172.16.214.110]\r\nhelo=[216.185.111.52])\r\n        by mx02.filter.theplanet.com (envelope-from\r\nabuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com)\r\n        with esmtp (Exim)\r\n        id 1F4w4L-000JiO-II; Fri, 03 Feb 2006 02:13:27 -0600\r\nReceived: from mx01 ([172.16.214.180] helo=mx01.filter.theplanet.com)\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com with esmtps (TLSv1:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:256)\r\n        (Exim 4.50) id 1F4w4I-0002kZ-3m\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Fri, 03 Feb 2006 02:13:22 -0600\r\nReceived: from wproxy.gmail.com ([64.233.184.194])\r\n        by mx01.filter.theplanet.com (envelope-from roughy@gmail.com)\r\n        with esmtp (Exim) id 1F4w4G-000Eb9-Sx\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Fri, 03 Feb 2006 02:13:21 -0600\r\nReceived: by wproxy.gmail.com with SMTP id 70so603231wra\r\n        for <abuse@theplanet.com>; Fri, 03 Feb 2006 00:13:20 -0800 (PST)\r\nDomainKey-Signature: a=rsa-sha1; q=dns; c=nofws; s=beta; d=gmail.com;\r\n \r\nh=received:message-id:date:from:to:subject:mime-version:content-type:content\r\n-transfer-encoding:content-disposition;\r\n \r\nb=V75QmIufyTQg3/0AfVUFf/zvYXiEprnlj2RkAPBAzdeaJ82/b8jGC9iC0CMvYOa5vo+QIL6VuO\r\nofK6CM28yC9psv7X+iBAO9x06AIM6htVZz2CoVpgUO2AgHI6hOXBAXM2B9XQalkZjY6hZaaJbOcX\r\nP3OgHcEK5wFt5l3DfC+QY=\r\nReceived: by 10.54.122.10 with SMTP id u10mr2061066wrc;\r\n        Fri, 03 Feb 2006 00:13:20 -0800 (PST)\r\nReceived: by 10.54.140.17 with HTTP; Fri, 3 Feb 2006 00:13:20 -0800 (PST)\r\nMessage-ID: <d3a6fcd10602030013r5ed223b5q81b556d0cbf63b60@mail.gmail.com>\r\nDate: Fri, 3 Feb 2006 00:13:20 -0800\r\nFrom: Roughy <roughy@gmail.com>\r\nTo: abuse@theplanet.com\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\nContent-Disposition: inline\r\nReceived-SPF: pass (mx01.filter.theplanet.com: domain of gmail.com\r\ndesignates\r\n        64.233.184.194 as permitted sender) client-ip=64.233.184.194;\r\n        envelope-from=roughy@gmail.com; helo=wproxy.gmail.com;\r\nX-Spam-Level: ---------------------------------------------------\r\nX-Spam-Score: -102.6\r\nCc: \r\nSubject: [ABUSE] Copyright Abuse\r\nX-BeenThere: abuse@lists.theplanet.com\r\nX-Mailman-Version: 2.1.5\r\nPrecedence: list\r\nList-Id: abuse.lists.theplanet.com\r\nList-Unsubscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=unsubscribe>\r\nList-Post: <mailto:abuse@lists.theplanet.com>\r\nList-Help: <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=help>\r\nList-Subscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=subscribe>\r\nSender: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\nErrors-To: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\nX-Spam-Level: /\r\nX-Spam-Score: 0.0\r\n","date_sent":"2006-02-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-02-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Unknown","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
