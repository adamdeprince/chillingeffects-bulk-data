In essence, a GIS application in transportation is maybe no longer a GIS, but a merger of GIS with Intelligent Transportation Systems or Transport Telematics, where GIS no longer exists as a stand-alone product. This essay will attempt to display the extent of existing GIS applications within road transportation, and critically assess their appropriateness and potential.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nUsing GIS in the field of transportation \"opens up a wide range of possible applications, as diverse as the field of transportation itself\". Whether these are cars and trucks along a road, trains along a track, ships across the sea or airplanes in the sky, all applications have one thing in common: They are objects that move along a path in space. A GIS \"can provide a valuable tool for managing these objects in a spatially referenced context, viewing the paths as a transportation network.\"","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.pacific-galaxy.com/u-city/u-its.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.husdal.com/1999/11/14/road-transportation-management-using-gis-vehicle-routing-and-tracking/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
