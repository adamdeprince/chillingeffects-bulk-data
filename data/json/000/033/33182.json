I am working with Celeste (Jennifer) to\r\nget her adult content removed from the internet. We have contacted the\r\nowners of the media (www.cumfiesta.com <outbind://41/www.cumfiesta.com>\r\n) and they have graciously removed her content from their pay service\r\nweb site. We are now following up with all of the various promoters of\r\nthe cumfiesta.com website politely asking that they remove their photos\r\nof Celeste because she is no longer available for download on the main\r\nwebsite.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible for you and your team of admins to remove these\r\nURLs and move the photo's/movies into a private non public_html folder?\r\n(The moving of the photo's into a non public_html folder will stop\r\ngoogle/yahoo image searches from returning the content after the .html\r\npages are removed) http://www.teenqueens.net/galleries/celeste.html\r\n<http://www.teenqueens.net/galleries/celeste.html> \r\n\r\nOr perhaps replace Celeste's pages with another model/woman?\r\n\r\nThe reason we are working on this is due to her personal safety. She has\r\nbeen attacked twice in 2006 by stalkers and her general safety is of\r\nconcern to us. People are crazy out there and we no longer want this\r\npoor decision which she made when she was 20 years old to continue to\r\neffect our family and life. Since the www.cumfiesta.com\r\n<outbind://41/www.cumfiesta.com>  web site is no longer selling her\r\nadult content would you please be so kind as to remove it from your\r\npromoting site?\r\n\r\nWe been working directly with RK Netmedia on this...specifically\r\nMauricio Botero. If you would like to contact him directly to confirm\r\nall of this that is ok too.
