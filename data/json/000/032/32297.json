My technical support team recently detected one of your clients abusing\r\ncontent from our website, which has dramatically affected our search engine results.\r\nThe website is www.wheeljungle.com and the content being stolen can be found hidden\r\nin the SOURCE CODE of this and many other web pages:\r\nhttp://wheeljungle.com/aza_staggered_wheels.html. \r\n  \r\nBecause the owner has chosen to hide his contact information, we are currently\r\nholding you responsible for the copyright infringement. You have 48 hours to take\r\naction before our legal team does. Please understand that we are a web-based\r\nbusiness with most of our clients coming from the web; therefore we are losing tens\r\nof thousands of dollars each day your client\u00a2s site remains online. \r\n  \r\nI can be reached directly at 310-980-2199. Please send us a confirmation the moment\r\nthe problem has been resolved. Thank you for your time and urgent attention to this\r\nmatter. \r\n  \r\nRegards,\r\nDimitris","date_sent":"2007-01-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"SpoiledCars.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
