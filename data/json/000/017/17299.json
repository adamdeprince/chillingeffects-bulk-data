You have a comment in your blog that is VERY LIBELOUS to Sound Loss & Claims and Belfor Construction.  I would inform you our file is EXTREMELY WELL DOCUMENTED!  I would inform you as well, Belfor Construction is owned by the largest privately owned corporation in the world.  Haniel Corp located in Germany.  I will be contacting the Washington State Attorney General regarding  this comment as well as our attorney.  We have informed Belfor Construction of this as well.  I wanted to inform you first to give you the opportunity to remove this first from your web site.
