{"dmca":{"id":11569,"type":"Dmca","title":"Individual complains of defamation, copyright infringement","body":"I would like to file a Digital Millennium Copyright Act Complaint against the Website epinions.com, blogspot.com, angelfire.com, and myspace.com and more specifically, the \"essay\" entitled, \"Volunteering for Crucifixion,\" located on the epinions.com Website.  Because the essay and its comment section contain material that is libelous, slanderous, defamatory, and harassing, as well as infringing on several of my copyrighted works, epinions.com's own bandwidth provider, Internap.com, has ordered the \"essay\" be removed from public view.  However, it is still cached in a Google search, and members of epinions.com can still view the comment section.  That is the problem.\r\n\r\nBelow is my Complaint of Copyright Infringement, written in the proper form:\r\n\r\n(1)The copyrighted work that has been infringed upon appears in the essay and the comment section of the \"essay\" entitled \"Volunteering for Crucifixion\" located in the Google cache at: \r\nhttp://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=volunteering+for+crucifixion \r\nand \r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356 \r\nand\r\nhttp://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:7KNAV_3udU4J:www.epinions.com/content_4222132356+volunteering+for+crucifixion&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1 \r\nand\r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356 \r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356/show_~allcom \r\nand\r\nhttp://our-late-lamented-nutcase.blogspot.com/ \r\nand\r\nhttp://blog.myspace.com/68876345 \r\nand\r\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/moon/lyagushka/inthelilypond.html \r\nThe copyrighted works at issue are many private, copyrighted journal entries and emails, posted in full, not in part, and written by me, and illegally obtained and definitely not authorized for use on the epinions.com Website or any other Website.  Although the author, \"lyagushka,\" says she has removed anything that infringes on my copyright, I allege that this is not so. \r\n(2) The Google Search Query that I used was:\r\n     Search Query:  Google\r\n     Infringing Web Pages:  Volunteering for Crucifixion\r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356\r\nhttp://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:7KNAV_3udU4J:www.epinions.com/content_4222132356+volunteering+for+crucifixion&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1 \r\n     Search Query:  Google\r\n     Infringing Web Pages:  Lily Remy\r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356 \r\nwww.epinions.com/content_4222132356/show_~allcom \r\n     Search Query:  Google\r\n     Infringing Web Pages:  Shana Zadrick Volunteering for Crucifixion\r\nhttp://our-late-lamented-nutcase.blogspot.com/ \r\n     Search Query:  Google\r\n     Infringing Web Pages:  inthelilypond myspace lyagushka\r\nhttp://blog.myspace.com/68876345 \r\n     Search Query:  Google\r\n     Infringing Web Pages:  inthelilypond angelfire\r\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/moon/lyagushka/inthelilypond.html \r\n(I have sent an electronic copy to removals@google.com )\r\n\r\n(3) My email address is [private]@gmail.com \r\n\r\n(4) The owners of the infringing Web pages can be contacted at: \r\n\r\nEpinions:\r\n  Epinions.Com, Inc., [private], Brisbane, CA 94005\r\n Blogspot:  Google, Inc., [private] Mountain View, CA 94043\r\n \r\nMySpace:  MySpace, [private] Los Angeles, CA 90045\r\n \r\nAngelfire:  Lycos, Inc., [private] Waltham, MA 02451\r\n \r\n(5) \"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above as allegedly infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\"\r\n \r\n(6) \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\"\r\n \r\n(7) [private]\r\n \r\nThank you very much for any help you will give me. \r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-04-13T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-13T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"[Individual]","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
