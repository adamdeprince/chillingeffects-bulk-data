The material on the site is false and inflammatory and utilizes copyrighted photos taken from a previous version of my website. I am a Vietnam veteran with 16 months of service in Vietnam validated by my DD214. I do not claim to be a Special Forces Veteran; I am an Ex Special Operations Veteran, The United States Army Security Agency.\r\n\r\nThis site is extortion based and has used Google to advance its goal to destroy my reputation and my business. Even a quick check of their links will show you how false their assertions and how dangerous these people are. I recommend that you remove all references to their site.\r\n\r\nThe photos on their site in the section related to me are protected photos I own.\r\n\r\nSearch Query: Ron Hood\r\nInfringing Web Pages: phonyveterans.com/Hood.html\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\nsearch term \r\n[private]\r\n...
