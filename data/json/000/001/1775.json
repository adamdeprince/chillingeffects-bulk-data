Please remove these infringing shops immediately from your website and cease and desist from selling any further infringing merchandise from these shops.\r\n\r\nPlease note that these sites were found after a cursory (10 minutes maximum) search around your website, and there are certainly more out there.  Consequently, I have attached a current Signatures Network artist roster, which should serve as a reference to help you to eliminate all Cafepress shops that infringe upon our intellectual property rights, and those of our artists.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will be the last notification that we need to make concerning the infringing merchandise for sale on your website.  Please be advised that we take such infringement matters very seriously, and will be forced to take legal action if this situation keeps reoccurring to such a large extent (note that our general counsel, [private], has recently been in contact with your outside counsel on this very issue).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n[Private], Esq.\r\nAssistant Counsel and Manager of Business Affairs","date_sent":"2003-07-15T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-07-15T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Signatures Network","recipient_name":"CafePress.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
