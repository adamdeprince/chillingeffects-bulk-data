(\"NCI\") in intellectual property matters. NCI is a leader in providing wireless telecommunications products and services throughout the world.  NCI has used its famous NEXTEL mark in connection with telecommunications services since at least as early as 1988 and owns several United States federal trademark registrations for the mark NEXTEL, including registration number 1,637,139 in International Class 38 for telecommunication services.  As a result of NCI's federal registrations and its continuous use of the mark since 1988, NCI has exclusive rights in and to the mark NEXTEL. \r\n \r\nIt has come to our attention that you have registered the domain name, http://www.nextelsucks.org/.  Your unauthorized registration and use of the http://www.nextelsucks.org/ domain name infringes our client's valuable trademark rights and unfairly trades upon NCI's fame and established good-will. The public is likely to be confused that the goods and services offered on your web site and other content on your website emanates from, or is sponsored by NCI.  Such confusion dilutes the strength and value of our client's mark(s).  \r\n \r\nThe activity that you are engaging in violates the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C.
