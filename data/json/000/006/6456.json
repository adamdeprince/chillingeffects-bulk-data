{"dmca":{"id":6456,"type":"Dmca","title":"Author wonders why takedown takes time","body":"On May 10, I faxed a Notice of Infringement to Blogger regarding this URL:\r\n\r\nhttp://outside-the-asylum.blogspot.com/2005/05/abc-says-rumsfeld-holding-fallen-idol.html\r\n\r\nIt was originally published at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spoofnews.com/content/view/229/31/\r\n\r\nI sent the original to Blogger by FedEx. It arrived on May 16. According to\r\nFedEx records, it was signed for by \"[private].\" The Proof of Delivery is\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I noticed that the material is still posted on Blogger. I know\r\nthat several other people have complained about the site's stated policy of\r\nbeing \"one-half plagiarized.\" I believe this incident is especially blatant\r\nbecause a 675+ word article was posted, and a comment giving me credit and a\r\nlink back to the article was deleted by the offending party.\r\n\r\nI believe this is a violation of the Blogspot.com Terms of Service, Section\r\n4, second paragraph, point e. I request that this material be removed\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nI have not gotten a response about the Notice of Infringement. When can I\r\nexpect a reply?\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nJohn Burgund ","date_sent":"2005-05-30T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-30T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"John Burgund","recipient_name":"Blogger [Google, Inc.]","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
