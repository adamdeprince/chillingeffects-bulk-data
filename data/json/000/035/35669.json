I'd also\r\nlike to point out that you do also host cracked versions of mousepad's\r\nmaphack, this too is a copyrighted piece of software that is being illegally\r\nhosted on your site, but since I don't represent the copyright holder I\r\ncan't officially ask you to remove it, but in case you don't want to receive\r\nfuture notices from mousepad, you might want to remove it as well.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in dealing with this matter, and I hope we don't\r\nhave any problems with your website again in the future.\r\n\r\nKass\r\n\r\nOn 7/13/05, Skyline_GTR <webmaster@gamerzplanet.net> wrote:\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> Those threads removed.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ---------GzP----------\r\n> -Skyline_GTR\r\n> Webmaster Of GzP\r\n> http://www.gamerzplanet.net\r\n> \r\n> ----- Original Message -----\r\n> From: \"Kass Lloyd\" <kasslloyd@gmail.com>\r\n> To: abuse@theplanet.com, jps@layeredtech.com, \r\n> dzq5m1javh.protect@whoisguard.com\r\n> Sent: Wednesday, July 13, 2005 06:07 PM\r\n> Subject: DMCA Notice\r\n> \r\n>  Dear Sir or Madam,\r\n> \r\n>  This letter serves as notification under the Digital Millennium  \r\n> Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
