{"dmca":{"id":7564,"type":"Dmca","title":"Cox User Receives Warning Without Information","body":"IMPORTANT NOTE: There was NO attachment included with this email notice. Therefore we do not know the identify of complaintant, what material allegedly \"infringes the copyrights of a complainant's members\". I replied asking for more information, at least a copy of the complaint. No response from the ISP as of this submission, and our account has not been disabled (yet?). I would like to know what we should do if Cox were to decide to disable our account, since Cox has a MONOPOLY on cable internet in Nevada. If we lost our account, my husband and I will be without Internet! We are both (and have always been) hard-working, law abiding citizens and would NEVER knowingly infringe on someone's copyrights.
