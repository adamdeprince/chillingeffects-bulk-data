The above referenced websites have been\r\nbrought to my attention by my clients, who have advised that a person\r\nutilizing your hosting services has improperly used the Oreck name,\r\nwhich is a federally protected trademark.  According to the contact\r\ninformation related to these websites, each is run by a Myricacymir\r\nMainonokys, at Boleronti St., 12-97 in Pekin, China 776543 (Tel: \r\n800735541087, Email darkover@ud-corp.com).  This person is not an\r\nauthorized dealer or service center for Oreck products and is not\r\nauthorized to use Oreck trademarks or otherwise hold out to the public\r\nas being authorized by, endorsed, or affiliated with Oreck. \r\nAccordingly, these practices constitute trademark infringement in\r\nviolation of state and federal law.  This person has yet to respond to\r\nOreck's complaints, and so my client is hoping that ThePlantet.com\r\nInternet Services, Inc. (\"ThePlanet.com\") will be responsive to\r\nresolving this situation involving a party who, among other things, has\r\nbreached your Acceptable Usage Policy (dated January, 15, 2007). \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nOreck Holdings, LLC is the owner in the United States of trademark\r\nregistration no. 1,454,954 for the mark, \"Oreck.\"  Oreck has protected\r\nits rights in this mark by securing federal trademark registration. \r\nThis registration, by law, places the public on notice of Oreck's sole\r\nand exclusive ownership throughout the United States of its exclusive\r\nrights in its mark, Oreck, in connection with vacuum cleaners and other\r\nhome care products. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nThe above referenced websites run by Myricacymir Mainonokys, hosted by\r\nThePlanet.com, use the Oreck mark in a manner that may cause confusion\r\nor mistakes in the minds of consumers, and thus violate Oreck's\r\nfederally protected rights to its name and marks.  Yet even if these\r\nwebpages did not cause actual confusion over Myricacymir Mainonokys' \r\nendorsement or affiliation with Oreck, this person's use of the mark\r\n\"Oreck\" on the webpages in question allow this person to free-ride\r\nOreck's goodwill and draw unwitting consumers to these websites,\r\ncreating initial interest confusion, an actionable offense under the\r\nfederal Lanham Act.  Moreover, the content of these websites, which\r\nincludes links and ads for adult websites, serves to tarnish Oreck's\r\ngood name, and therefore dilutes its trademark under the federal Lanham\r\nAct, an offense that requires neither that the infringer be a competitor\r\nof Oreck, nor that one confuses unwitting consumers.  It is Oreck's\r\nposition that Myricacymir Mainonokys is liable for each of these\r\noffenses.  While Oreck understands that ThePlanet.com likely did not\r\nhave knowledge of this infringement, it is the intention of this letter\r\nto bring such infringement to your attention.  Such infringement is, in\r\nfact, a violation of your Intellectual Property Infringement Policy,\r\nwhich is a part of your larger Acceptable Usage Policy. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nTherefore, with the knowledge that Myricacymir Mainonokys is infringing\r\nupon Oreck's federal trademark rights, Oreck requests that ThePlanet.com\r\ndisable access to, or remove the infringing content from your servers. \r\nFailure to do so will result in Oreck pursuing any and all remedies\r\nafforded under state and federal law.  At the very least, this will\r\nencompass injunctions against use of this mark against Myricacymir\r\nMainonokys as a direct infringer and ThePlanet.com as a contributory\r\ninfringer.  If I do not see the Oreck mark removed from the above sites\r\nwithin one week, or by January 26, 2007, I will be forced to consider\r\nfiling a trademark infringement suit against both Myricacymir Mainonokys\r\nand ThePlanet.com, in Louisiana federal court. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nIt is my sincere hope, however, that this end can be avoided, and the\r\nproblem solved amicably.  I thank you in advance for ThePlanet.com's\r\nassistance in this matter.  In the event that you should have any\r\nquestions, please contact me at your convenience. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nRespectfully, \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n/MTW/ \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nMichael T.
