There is no possible way that the work is\r\nused on that website with the exact code provided on my website. \r\n\r\nPlease view http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.htm\r\n\r\nThe exact statement is \"Reuse other than use with this code is prosecutable by law\". \r\n\r\nSillydog.org only allows use of BBCode in its for which would require the script be\r\nchanged from the following:\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\r\n<a href=\"http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.htm\">\r\n<img src=\"http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.PNG\" \r\nalt=\"mothafuckest\" style=\"border: 0px;\"> </a> <br /> <a\r\nhref=\"http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.htm\">Get this image free</a> </div>\r\n\r\nto the following:\r\n\r\n[img]http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.PNG][url]http://images.ronsnex\r\nus.com/mothafuckest.htm[/url][/img]\r\n[URL=http://images.ronsnexus.com/mothafuckest.htm]Get this image free[/url]\r\n\r\n\r\nEven then, the image is not displayed as centered. With this, the site still is\r\nunable to use the exact code, thus violating the notice. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, at the time of your investigation, the website was still offline,\r\nwhich they conveniently had to do \"maintenance\". Though in there history, the site\r\nhas never been known to completely shut down for updates or maintenance. With this\r\nstated, I would like to request a second investigation of this matter. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Copyright [mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com]\r\nSent: Friday, June 16, 2006 5:11 PM\r\nTo: ron@ronsnexus.com\r\nCc: Theplanet@chillingeffects.org\r\nSubject: FW: [Fwd: [ABUSE] copyright violation]\r\n\r\n \r\nTo Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nPlease note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice does not\r\nsubstantially comply with the required notification elements of the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of your claim.\r\n\r\nPlease visit our web site at www.theplanet.com/legal.\r\n \r\nLegal Response Team\r\nTHEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuseadm@theplanet.com [mailto:abuseadm@theplanet.com] On Behalf Of Policy\r\nEnforcement Posted At: Friday, June 16, 2006 7:07 AM Posted To: Copyright\r\nConversation: [Fwd: [ABUSE] copyright violation]\r\nSubject: [Fwd: [ABUSE] copyright violation]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor your review.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/\r\n\r\n-------- Original Message --------\r\nSubject: [ABUSE] copyright violation\r\nDate: Fri, 16 Jun 2006 03:41:08 -0400\r\nFrom: Ron Williams <ron@ronsnexus.com>\r\nTo: <abuse@theplanet.com>\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nI have tried resolving the issue with the violator Antony Shen regarding use of my\r\ncontent illegally, however this has failed and has caused me as my last resort\r\nbefore taking legal action, to contact his host to have the content removed.\r\n\r\nBelow is an e-mail that was sent to Antony Shen on 6/12/06, 6/13/06, and 6/14/06.\r\n\r\nAttention Antony Shen and/or owner of the domain name sillydog.org.\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as a notification for cease and desist under the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
