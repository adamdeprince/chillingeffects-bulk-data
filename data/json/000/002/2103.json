{"dmca":{"id":2103,"type":"Dmca","title":"NOT A CEASE AND DESIST","body":"My filter tells me I am getting these emails from you.  You have already been told how to create a filter yourself.  Cease and desist or I will contact the Dean of Student to file a complaint.\r\n\r\nHere is information on creating a filter again:\r\n\r\nThese e-mails are sent to all active bgnet accounts.  It is not possible to remove your name from the list unless you have your bgnet account closed.  This is not a listproc; it is a broadcaste e-mail.  It is possible to filter these emails so they go directly into the trash.  You need to go under the \"Special\" menu and scroll down to \"Make Filter\".  The instructions are self-explanatory from that point.  If you have further questions, contact (419) 372-0999 for technical support (not Marketing and Communications).\r\n","date_sent":"2003-10-01T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-10-01T04:00:00Z","topics":["Uncategorized","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Department of Marketing and Communications","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
