Incidentally, he uses Adsense on each page.\r\n\r\n1.The copyrighted work at issue is both text and some graphics in the tutorial pages listed.\r\n\r\nThe search term I used was a sentence off my site, because my site is still in the Google Sandbox, so it's doesn't yet come up for any standard keyword combos.\r\n2. Search term used (with quotes): \"HTML looks much scarier than it is\" and I get the first page below: Original Page\tPlagiarized Page\r\n \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/beginning-html.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/\t   \r\nAdditional plagiarized pages are as follows:\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/html2.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/basic1.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/body-attributes.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/body_attributes.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/hyperlinks.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/hyperlinks.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/tables.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/tables.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/formatting-tables.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/formatting_tables.htm\r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/cellpadding.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/cellpadding.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/tablecolor.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/colortables.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/text.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/text_fonts.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/fonts.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/fonttags.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/web-graphics.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/using_graphics.htm\r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/img-tag.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/insert_image.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/webdesign-programs.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/web_design.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/web-templates.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/templates.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/domain-names.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/domain.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/webhosting.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/webhosting.htm\t\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/css.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/css.htm\r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/css2.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/stylesheet.htm\t   \r\nhttp://www.websitebeginner.com/serverside-includes.shtml\thttp://www.certblogger.com/html/ssi.htm\t \r\n\r\n3. my email is: [private]@websitebeginner.com\r\n\r\n4. the plagiarizers email is: [private]@certblogger.com\r\n\r\n5.
