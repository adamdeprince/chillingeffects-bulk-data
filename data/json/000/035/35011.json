In this application, the sensor is attached to the neoprene material that flexes and stretches and functions under water. The sensor sends signals to an electronic potentiostat, built on a small 19 mm x 19 mm board that has a battery at its back. This assembly is inside the wetsuit.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.electroiq.com/nanotech/2011/07/1452655719/nanotech-sensors-embeded-in-facbrics-to-identify-underwater-contamination.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/nanotech-sensors-embeded-in-facbrics-to-identify-underwater-contamination/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
