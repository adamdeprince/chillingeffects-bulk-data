It has come to Equity's attention that you offer to sell, distribute or trade unauthorized video and audio recordings of live musical performances by members of Actors' Equity.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that 18 U.S.C. 2319A makes it a felony to transmit, distribute or offer to distribute for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain sound or video recordings \"without the consent of the performer or performers involved.\" \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, \"bootleg\" recordings, and their distribution, violate the copyright laws and the rights of Actors' Equity members under their collective bargaining agreements with theatrical producers.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEquity therefore insists you cease further web references or links to these \"bootleg\" recordings immediately.  Equity is prepared if necessary to take appropriate legal action to ensure that its members' rights are protected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nACTORS' EQUITY ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n(via email)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDwane M.
