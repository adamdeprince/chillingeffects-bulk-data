The specific site in question is\r\nhttp://www.contentconcepts.net/. This copyright violation came to my\r\nattention when I crosschecked my page\r\nhttp://www.editorsforstudents.com/editing.html on http://www.copyscape.com. \r\n\r\nText plagiarized from EditorsForStudents.com includes the following, at the\r\nURL listed below:\r\n\r\nAt http://www.contentconcepts.net/ the following text was plagarized from\r\nwww.edtiorsforstudents.com/editing.html (text plagiarized from\r\nEditorsForStudents.com is in bold)::\r\n\r\n\r\nGrammar: Errors in grammar, correct subject-verb agreement, pronoun\r\nreferents, run-on and fragmented sentences, weak or improper verb usage, and\r\nother fatal grammatical mistakes are checked.\r\n\r\nStyle & Voice: We work to give it a unique style and voice, eliminating\r\nawkward or vague words and phrases and replacing them with elegant and\r\nprecise ones, ensuring that your writing is not only more consistent, but\r\nalso more professional.\r\n\r\nIn addition to plagiarizing specific text from EditorsForStudents.com,\r\ncontentconcepts.net has taken the basic editorial categories (the \"services\r\noffered\" at EditorsForStudents.com) and placed them on their site, creating\r\na list of services that closely imitates Editors For Student's. For\r\ninstance, contentconcepts.net has plagiarized the category \"Style & Voice\"\r\ndown to the ampersand in this descriptive phrase.\r\n\r\nArchive.org will show that the plagiarized copy originally appeared on my\r\npage. In all likelihood, judging from my past experience, plagiarized copy\r\nboth from EditorsForStudents.com and other sites appears on other pages at\r\ncontentconcepts.net.\r\n\r\nContentconcepts.net's flagrant plagraisim creates the impression that copy\r\nappearing on my site may itself have been plagiarized, and therefore\r\nundermines the originality and veracity of editorsforstudents.com. As a\r\nresult, I'm forced to write to request, pursuant to the recommendations of\r\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that you take further action,\r\nincluding, if necessary, removing Contentconcepts.net from it's current home\r\non the Internet until their site is revised to comply with copyright law.\r\n\r\nUnder the penalty of perjury, I attest that the information contained in\r\nthis email is true and correct and that contentconcepts.net has not been\r\nauthorized to use the text of EditorsForStudents.com. As the president of\r\nEditorsForStudents.com, I am authorized to lodge this complaint against the\r\noffending party.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJames Brown, President\r\nEditorsForStudents.com\r\n\r\n45 North Market St. #306\r\nLancaster, PA 17603\r\nPh: 717-431-8932\r\nFax: 717-291-1485\r\nbrown@editorsforstudents.com","date_sent":"2006-03-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-03-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"EditorsForStudents.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
