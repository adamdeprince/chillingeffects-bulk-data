In this page http://www.fanyicn.net/bbs/read.php?tid-418.html the webmaster insults me with very bad words, published my private information, bank account, my girl friend's email and family address and phone number, all my person information he ever hacked into my PC and stoled.\r\n\r\nOnly publishing person's bank account number can be taken as serious criminal offense. I have several times applied for removal of this page ( deindexing the page ) via Google removal page, yet I got no a result.\r\n\r\nNow things become more insufferable since Google can not identify a real criminal and allows the criminal to continue harm kind people\r\n, to do evil to people.\r\n\r\nI ever also reported this criminal website's purpose is to gather and organize hackers to hack google and other overseas internet, see here please:\r\nhttp://fanyicn.net/bbs/hack/\r\n\r\nBut I am very sorry google ignored my report.\r\n\r\n\r\nI also reported this is a fisher's website the webmaster intends to fish people's bank account via request user to fill in his bank account information to play a game.
