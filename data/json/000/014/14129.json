However, it is important to address a few critical issues at this point.\r\n\r\nFirst, at this time, Ms. Davis is not able to access the SoSoy Co. offices or her personal items in the office. This is due to actions you have taken to exclude Ms. Davis from the SoSoy Co. premises. As you may know, over the past week, Ms. Davis has made several attempts to gain access to the building. Such attempts have been unsuccessful. There are several items Ms. Davis wishes to retrieve from the office. Specifically, items in the office belonging to Ms. Davis include: the Apple G4 computer; her portfolio, including personal artwork; and various childhood toys, including milk trucks and bottles. At this time, Ms. Davis hereby demands that all personal items, including but not limited to the above-listed items, be returned to her. Alternatively, please advise me of when we can arrange to have someone pick up Ms. Davis","date_sent":"2006-05-12T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-05-12T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Banowsky & Levine","principal_name":"Sue Ellen Davis/ SoSoy Co. / SoSoy Co.
