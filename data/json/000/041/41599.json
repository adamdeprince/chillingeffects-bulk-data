(RIAA) and its member record companies. The RIAA is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies create, manufacture and\r\ndistribute approximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound\r\nrecordings sold in the United States. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member\r\ncompanies on matters involving the infringement of their sound\r\nrecordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights\r\non the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting files on the above\r\nreferenced web pages on your network. These files offer images for\r\ndownload of the artist known as Jay-Z. These images have not been\r\nauthorized for this kind of use. We have a good faith belief that the\r\nabove-described activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its\r\nagent, or the law. We assert that the information in this\r\nnotification is accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this\r\nunauthorized activity. Specifically, we request that you remove the\r\ninfringing material from your system and that you inform the site\r\noperator of the illegality of his or her conduct.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that\r\nthis site operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring\r\non your service. In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright\r\nAct, if you ignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be\r\nliable for any resulting infringement. This letter does not\r\nconstitute a waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue\r\nof any such unauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims\r\nfor other relief are expressly retained.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at RIAA, [private]\r\nWashington, D.C.,[private], Tel. [private], or e-mail\r\n[private]@riaa.com, to discuss this notice. We await your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[private]\r\n\r\nOnline Anti-Piracy\r\n\r\nConverted by [private]","date_sent":"2007-09-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-09-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
