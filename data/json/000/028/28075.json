Its a clear copyright violation and should be \r\nconsidered as warez. \r\n \r\nURL: \r\nTheir website: http://www.phpbbtheme.com/ \r\n \r\nWhere they stole it from: \r\nConundrum, Chairs: designed by mikelothar.com Morpheus, Aeolus, AcidTech: \r\ndesigned by me: phpbbstyles.com Charcoal, AirHead: designed by Zarron Media: \r\nzarron.com etc..  everything is stolen. \r\n \r\nProofs: \r\n1. You can confirm authors for few styles at urls I provided above. \r\n2. Some of designs are offered on phpbb.com with original designer's \r\ncopyrights. You can find them here: \r\nhttp://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/catdb.php?db=2 \r\n3: Almost all of those designs are offered on phpbbhacks.com: \r\nhttp://www.phpbbhacks.com/templates.php \r\nYou can see designs with exactly the same names on that website and by \r\nclicking on demo links you'll see correct copyright of original author, \r\nwhich has nothing to do with abuser's website. \r\n \r\nMore detailed proof: \r\nYou can confirm that designs are indeed stolen by downloading them from \r\nabuser's website, unpacking and looking in file \"overall_footer.tpl\" (its a \r\ntext file). You will see that they have replaced designer's copyright with \r\ntheir own. \r\n \r\n \r\nWho am I, and why you should belive me instead of abuser: \r\nI'm former phpBB team member, which you can confirm on \r\nhttp://www.phpbb.com/about/ (I'm listed in \"Past Contributors\" \r\nsection) \r\n \r\nI have also informed other designers who's designs are stolen by abuser, so \r\nyou can expect emails from them too, and in case if my proof is not \r\nconvincing enough I'm sure they'll provide different proof. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nVjacheslav Trushkin. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-02-15T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-15T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
