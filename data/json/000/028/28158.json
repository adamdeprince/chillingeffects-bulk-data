We note that viewing this material requiring scrolling down, as\r\nyour customer has misleadingly placed only a link titled \"enter\" on the\r\nfirst viewable part of the screen. Accordingly, the infringement is not\r\ndomain name-related as your e-mail states. Rather, your customer's\r\nflagrant misuse of Pizza Hut's PIZZA HUT mark on the website located at\r\nhttp://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html infringes and tarnishes Pizza Hut's\r\nmark and name.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, Pizza Hut again asks The Planet remove the website located\r\nat the URL http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html. \r\n\r\nWe look forward to your reconsideration of this take-down request.\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nJulia Anne Matheson\r\nFinnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP\r\n901 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001 \r\nTel. 202-408-4020 \r\nFax 202-408-4400\r\nE-mail: julia.matheson@finnegan.com\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: Copyright [mailto:copyright@theplanet.com] \r\n        Sent: Friday, March 02, 2007 3:10 PM\r\n        To: Gutowski, Leslie\r\n        Subject: RE: Trademark Infringement; IP addresses 70.87.64.74\r\nand 70.87.64.75; sent on behalf of Julia Anne Matheson, Esq.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        The disputed material in the below-pasted e-mail is the domain\r\nname, not the content of the website. As an ISP, we are compelled by\r\nFederal Law to disable access of website if it infringes copyright or\r\ntrademark rights of third parties. This is not the case since the\r\nwebsite www.dfcn10.info neither uses the Trademark PIZZA HUT on his\r\nwebsite nor has PIZZA HUT content display there. As the disputed\r\nmaterial is the domain name and it is not under our control, because it\r\nwas not registered with us. This issue should be resolved either by the\r\nregistrar of the domain name dfcn10.info or ICANN.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        Legal Response Team\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        ________________________________\r\n\r\n                From: Gutowski, Leslie\r\n[mailto:leslie.gutowski@finnegan.com] \r\n        Sent: Friday, March 02, 2007 8:06 AM\r\n        To: Copyright\r\n        Cc: Matheson, Julia Anne\r\n        Subject: Trademark Infringement; IP addresses 70.87.64.74 and\r\n70.87.64.75; sent on behalf of Julia Anne Matheson, Esq.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        March 2, 2007\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        Via E-mail Only (copyright@theplanet.com)\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        The Planet.com Internet Services, Inc. d/b/a The Planet\r\n\r\n        1333 North Stemmons Freeway, Suite 110\r\n\r\n        Dallas, TX  75207\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        Subject:  Trademark Infringement; IP addresses 70.87.64.74 and\r\n70.87.64.75\r\n\r\n        Dear The Planet Representative:\r\n\r\n        We represent Pizza Hut, Inc. and its parent company Yum! Brands,\r\nInc. (\"Pizza Hut\").  Under penalty of perjury, we declare that the\r\ninformation contained in this notice is accurate, and that we are\r\nauthorized to act on Pizza Hut's behalf in this matter.\r\n\r\n        Since its inception in 1958, Pizza Hut has evolved into the\r\nworld's largest pizza restaurant company with locations in more than 90\r\ncountries around the world.  Pizza Hut owns the trademark and trade name\r\nPIZZA HUT, and owns numerous trademark registrations for that mark in\r\nthe United States and other countries worldwide.  Pizza Hut has invested\r\nconsiderable resources over the years in establishing and promoting its\r\nvaluable PIZZA HUT mark and name.  As a result of these efforts, the\r\nPIZZA HUT mark has become famous and an asset of incalculable value.   \r\n\r\n        We are writing to notify you that a customer of The Planet is\r\nusing your Internet services to infringe Pizza Hut's intellectual\r\nproperty rights.  Specifically, the customer is operating a pornographic\r\nwebsite located at the URL http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html that\r\nuses The Planet's IP addresses 70.87.64.74 and 70.87.64.75.  In addition\r\nto using the PIZZA HUT mark in the URL, this website displays numerous\r\nand gratuitous references to the PIZZA HUT mark and domain name in a\r\nclear attempt to game search engines and increase the amount of Internet\r\ntraffic to that website.  The http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html\r\nwebsite therefore infringes and tarnishes Pizza Hut's trademark rights.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        We have a good faith belief that the use of the PIZZA HUT\r\ntrademark on the http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html website and in the\r\nURL for that website are not authorized by Pizza Hut, any agent of Pizza\r\nHut, or under the law.  \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        Accordingly, Pizza Hut requests that The Planet remove the\r\nwebsite located at the URL http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html\r\n<http://dfcn10.info/Pizzahut.com.html> .  In view of the severity and\r\nurgency of this matter, Pizza Hut requests that immediate action be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        We look forward to receiving The Planet's response to this\r\nrequest.  Thank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n        Julia Anne Matheson\r\n\r\n        Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP\r\n\r\n        901 New York Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001\r\n\r\n        Tel. 202-408-4020\r\n\r\n        Fax 202-408-4400\r\n\r\n        E-mail: julia.matheson@finnegan.com\r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n         \r\n\r\n        \r\n        This e-mail message is intended only for individual(s) to whom\r\nit is addressed and may contain information that is privileged,\r\nconfidential, proprietary, or otherwise exempt from disclosure under\r\napplicable law.
