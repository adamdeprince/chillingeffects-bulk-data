Yes, I can provide more helpful info regarding my\n\ncomplaint about this massive copyright infringement. However, I don't have\n\ncopyright registration numbers. But I do have a copyright notice on all my\n\npages saying the content is onwed by me and cannot be copied without my\n\npermission. \n\n\nI am a freelance writer and web designer. I travelled the country of Zambia\n\nat my own expense and researched and wrote the text that is on my website\n\nwww.zambiatourism.com \n\n\nwww.zambiatravelguide.com and also www.ezambia.com (same people) have\n\nbasically copied every single page of mine and created competitive sites -\n\nwith my words - word for word! Occasionally they leave off the first\n\nsentence but 99.9% of the text is mine. You will see they have often used\n\nmy pictures too!\n\n\nHere is a list of a few examples - my page and then their corresponding\n\npage on both their other sites. It really should not be allowed and they\n\nare ignoring my request to change their text. You are my only hope !\n\n\n\nMINE: http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/places/victoria.htm \n\nTHEIRS: http://www.zambiatravelguide.com/victoria-falls.html \n\nTHEIR OTHER SITE:\n\nhttp://www.ezambia.com/component/content/article/34-places-to-visit/54-\nvicto\n\nria-falls.html \n\n\n\nMINE: http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/nationalparks/sluangwa.htm \n\nTHEIRS: http://www.zambiatravelguide.com/-south-luangwa.html \n\nTHEIR OTHER SITE:\n\nhttp://www.ezambia.com/component/content/article/37-game-reserves/50-south-\nl\n\nuangwa.html \n\n\n\nMINE: http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/nationalparks/kafue.htm \n\nTHEIRS: http://www.zambiatravelguide.com/kafue.html \n\nTHEIR OTHER SITE:\n\nhttp://www.ezambia.com/component/content/article/37-game-reserves/74-kafue-\nn\n\national-park.html \n\n\nMINE: http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/traveladvice/general.htm \n\nTHEIRS: http://www.zambiatravelguide.com/general-info-at-a-glance.html \n\nTHEIR OTHER SITE:\n\nhttp://www.ezambia.com/component/content/article/46-travel-guide/112-\ngeneral\n\n-info-at-a-glance.html \n\n\nMINE: http://www.zambiatourism.com/travel/hisgeopeop/people.htm \n\nTHEIRS:\n\nhttp://www.zambiatravelguide.com/travel-guide/162-people-of-zambia.html \n\nTHEIR OTHER SITE:\n\nhttp://www.ezambia.com/component/content/article/46-travel-guide/162-people-\n\nof-zambia.html \n\n\nAnd so it goes on, they have copied over 150 pages of my text and listings,\n\nand simply copied it into theirs, using my pictures, my headings, my\n\nstructure. \n\n\n\nI have also heard that my site may be penalised (ie lose rank or result\n\nposition?) for having text that is duplicated on other sites - is this\ntrue?\n\n\n\nMany thanks for your time and consideration\n\n\nKind regards\n\nAngie\n\n","date_sent":"2011-07-11T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2011-07-11T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Africa Insites","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
