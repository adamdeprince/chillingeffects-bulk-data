I clicked on it and was\r\ntaken to a site that had, all the way at the bottom of the page, a link\r\nthat said my name and then the word nude.  It was a link to a movie site\r\ncalled www.moviereality.com.  The movie would not load (Thank God).  My\r\npoint of writing is that whoever is posting this site which features\r\ninformation about me did it without my knowledge and certainly without\r\nmy consent.  My legal counsel has advised me to request that the site be\r\nturned off.   \r\n     Even if this is not enough reason, the site itself has many other\r\nlinks to this same site, which upon trying to open the links my security\r\nsystem advised me of the prescence of  Trojan Horse in the software.  So\r\nit seems that the site should be shut down even wihout reference to\r\nmyself as it could endanger other customers of yours. \r\n \r\nI guess I didn't explain yet that I tracerouted the site back to you\r\nguys so I believe you may be the host server for the site. \r\nThe site is\r\nnude.jhyujik.org/cara-lammey-nude.html\r\nAll of the other sites on this domain name contain the same virus laden\r\nlinks. \r\n \r\nThank you for your time and I would appreciate if this could be turned\r\noff.  \r\nThanks,\r\nCara Lammey \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-07-20T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-07-20T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Cara Lammey","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
