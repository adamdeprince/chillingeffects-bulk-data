I asked him at the time if it were possible to use his software on a trial basis.\r\n\r\nWhilst I have been developing Deal Zoo site ready to launch, David stole the idea, taking the brand and its concept and using it for his own website. This has prevented me from creating my own site.\r\n\r\nThe website in question is http://dealzoo.com.au\r\n\r\nI believe I have a case which would mean his site has to be taken down, re-named, removed from search results or compensate me. I will be contacting his web host in due course.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the examples are just some of the files which contain my brand and website design.\r\n\r\nThe brand, website idea has been completely stolen by David.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://dealzoo.com.co/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://dealzoo.co.uk/old/files/home-page.png"},{"url":"http://dealzoo.co.uk/old/dealzoo.png"},{"url":"http://dealzoo.co.uk/old/files/product-listing-page.png/"},{"url":"http://dealzoo.co.uk/old/characters.png"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
