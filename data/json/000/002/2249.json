Renault's new Megane RS Trophy is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine that delivers 265 hp and 360 Nm of torque between 3,000 to 5,000 rpm. This is 15 hp and 20 Nm more than the previous version. To get the extra power, Renault increased the boost pressure in the Megane RS Trophy by 0.2 bar, to a total of 2.5 bar. To be able to manage the extra boost, Renault re-designed the air intake for the Megane RS Trophy, which is now able to cope with higher pressure and higher running temperatures. With these output figures, the Renault Megane RS Trophy has a 5.09kg/hp power-to-weight ratio and a specific power of 132.5hp/litre. \r\nRenault's official specifications say that the Megane RS Trophy is able to accelerate from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 6.0 seconds, which is 0.1 seconds faster, and that it has a top speed of 254 km/h (4 km/h more than before). The Megane RS Trophy is able to run the first 1000 meters from a standing start in 25.4 seconds. \r\n\r\nWith the Megane RS Trophy, Renault went for a fine-tuned Cup chassis, a standard limited slip differential, and Formula 1-inspired Bridgestone Potenza RE050A asymmetric, directional tread tires. \"\r\n\r\nWhich was copied at these infringing URLs:\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227140\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227242\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227028\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227141\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227145\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227215\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227260\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227276\r\nhttp://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227277","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227140"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227242"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227028"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227141"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227145"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227215"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227260"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227276"},{"url":"http://www.fccuk.org/forum/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=1227277"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.zercustoms.com/news/Renault-Megane-RS-Trophy.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
