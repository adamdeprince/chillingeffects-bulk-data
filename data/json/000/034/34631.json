I had given Gable\r\nConstruction copies of these pictures for the purpose of maintaining a\r\nhistory of the construction they were performing.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt no time did I ever give them verbal or written permission to use them\r\nfor any other purpose, and would never consider doing so.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAccording to the legal section on your own website: \r\n\r\n\"Intellectual Property Infringement Policy\r\n\r\nCustomers may not transmit, distribute, download, copy, cache, host, or\r\notherwise store on a Server any information, data, material, or work\r\nthat infringes the intellectual property rights of others.
