{"dmca":{"id":8018,"type":"Dmca","title":"Scientology objects to \"ScienTOMogy\"","body":"Dear [Private]:\r\n\r\n     Our office represents Religious Technology Center (\"RTC\"), the owner of\r\nthe federally registered trademark and service mark \"SCIENTOLOGY\".  The\r\n\"SCIENTOLOGY\" mark is registered with the United States Patent and\r\nTrademark Office under registration numbers 1,755,441; 1,540,928; 1,342,353;\r\n1,329,474; 1,318,717; 1,306,997; and 0898018.  \"SCIENTOLOGY\" is also registered\r\nas a trade and service mark in numerous countries throughout the world,\r\nincluding New Zealand under registration numbers B 119,381; 153,974; 180,601; \r\nB 153,085; B 153,086; 180600.  We also represent the Church of Scientology\r\nInternational (\"CSI\"), which is the licensee of the \"Scientology\" trademark.   \r\n\r\n     We have been advised that you have registered a domain name with\r\nEnom, Inc., a United States domain registrar and agreed, through Enom's\r\nRegistration Agreement, Governing Law and Jurisdiction for Disputes, to submit\r\nto the jurisdiction of Bellevue, Washington, regarding the following domain\r\nname:\r\n\r\n          \"Scientomogy.info\"\r\n\r\n     You are hereby on notice that the registration and use of this domain name\r\nin this fashion has caused your name to be falsely associated with our client's\r\nregistered mark, SCIENTOLOGY,  as owner and creates a likelihood of confusion\r\nas to the source or sponsorship of this domain name in violation of United States\r\nstate and federal law, including the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u0015 1125(a). \r\n\r\n     The fact that you have changed one letter (\" m\" instead of \"l\") does not\r\nprotect you from trademark infringement.  Huish Detergents, Inc. v. Orange Glo\r\nIntern, Inc., 2002 WL 32157171 (D.Utah 2002) (holding that minor differences in\r\nspelling and variations and arrangements of letters was insufficient to protect\r\nagainst trademark infringement);  Salton, Inc. v. Cornwall Corporation, 477 F.Supp.\r\n975 (D.C.N.J. 1979) (holding that,  even though not completely identical,\r\ndefendant's term was so like the plaintiff's in form, spelling, and sound as to\r\nconstitute trademark infringement).  The adoption of the term \"Scientomogy\" is\r\nso like the federally registered trademark \"Scientology\" in form, spelling and\r\nsound as to constitute infringement pursuant to the Lanham TradeMark Act, 15\r\nU.S.C. \u0015 1114.  AMF v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 (9th Cir. 1979); G.D. Searle &\r\nCompany v. Chas. Pfizer & Company, 265 F.2d 385 (7th Cir. 1959).\r\n\r\n     Likewise, our client's registered trademark is famous, distinctive and\r\nunique.  Registering and using the Scientology mark in this manner dilutes and\r\ntarnishes the distinctiveness of the mark in violation of the federal trademark\r\nantidilution statute, 15 U.S.C. \u0015 1125(c) and California's antidilution statute,\r\nCalifornia Bus. & Prof. Code \u0015 14330.  See, Archdiocese of St. Louis v. Internet\r\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 34 F.Supp.2d 1145 (E.D. Mo. 1999); Mattel, Inc. v.\r\nInternet dimensions, Inc., 55 U.S.P.Q.2d 1620 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Deere & Co. v. MTD\r\nProducts, Inc., 41 F.3d 39, 43 (2nd Cir. 1994); Century 21 Real Estate Corporation v.\r\nSandlin, 846 F.2d 1175 (9th Cir. 1988); Grey v. Campbell Soup Company, 650 F.Supp.\r\n1166 (D.C. Cal. 1986).\r\n\r\n     Your use of  our client's mark in this manner  also constitutes an unlawful\r\nfalse designation of origin and as such, violates \u0015 43(a) of the Lanham Trade-\r\nMark Act.  This prohibits any use of another's trademarks that is \"likely to cause\r\nconfusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or\r\nassociation of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship,\r\nor approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another\r\nperson.\"  America Online, Inc. v. IMS, 24 F.Supp.2d 548, 551 (E.D.Va. 1998). \r\n\r\n     The Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (\"ACPA\") is also\r\nimplicated by your registration and attempted sale of this domain name.  Shields\r\nv. Zuccarini, 254 F.3d 476 (3rd Cit. 2001).  Statutory damages can be awarded for\r\nviolation of the Act in an amount not less than $1,000 and not more than $100,000\r\nfor each domain name.  15 U.S.C. Section 1117(d).  The court in Shields imposed a\r\n$30,000 statutory damage award against a cybersquatter under the Act.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, trademark rights subsist in New Zealand in our client's\r\ntrademarks by virtue of the Paris Convention (to which New Zealand and the\r\nUnited States are signatories) which provides that United States citizens shall be\r\ngiven the same treatment in New Zealand with regard to trademark protection as\r\nthat available to citizens of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n     Accordingly, we ask that you cease and desist use of this domain name\r\nand transfer it to our client, CSI.  We are willing to pay for your registration and\r\ntransfer fees incurred in this matter.\r\n\r\n     I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[Private]\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2005-09-14T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-09-14T04:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Moxon & Kobrin","principal_name":"Religious Technology Center","recipient_name":"registrant, scientomogy.info","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
