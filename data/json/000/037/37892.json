The site\r\nis: http://hghspray.pillslist.info. He has stolen all of the written\r\nmaterial from my website at www.hgh2live.com and until today, he even was\r\nusing my picture and that of my grandson under the bogus name Dr.\r\nAndrew Johnson with grandson George. If you go to his site now, you will see\r\na goofy graph where the picture used to be. He is obviously running scared.\r\nBut he is still using all of my written materials. If you click on his\r\nReport (which is my report) and scroll down to the bottom of it, you will\r\nsee that the phone number listed for \"Dr. Johnson\" is 512 295 4256. That is\r\nmy phone number! He foolishly left it in there. Please shut him down right\r\naway. He is committing a crime, and I have already filed a complaint with\r\nthe FBI. Please help me with this. I can be reached at this email adress or\r\nat the number given above. Thank you. Dr. Ralph Cinque\r\n\r\n\r\n With MSN Spaces email straight to your blog.
