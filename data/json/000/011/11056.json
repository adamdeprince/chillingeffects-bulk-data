{"dmca":{"id":11056,"type":"Dmca","title":"Perfect 10 complains again, of copyright infringement and rights of publicity","body":"Dear Amazon,\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a DMCA notice. We have discovered that when Perfect 10 models names are inputted into your search engine, thousands of Perfect 10 images are distributed for free, destroying the value of our images and our business, and promoting the websites that misappropriated our images in the process.\r\n\r\nI have previously sent you declarations from Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Anna Kournikova, Yasmine Bleeth, and Rebecca Gayheart indicating that they have not authorized any celebrity porn site to use their names or images. With this information, this DMCA notice, and the many disclaimers on celebrity porn sites, you should realize (if you do not already) that virtually all the \"celebrity porn\" sites that Amazon has in its search index (those that advertise nude images of mainstream celebrities) do not have the rights to their content. If your company is really serious about respecting intellectual property rights, you should require licenses or some other proof that celebrity porn sites own ANY of their celebrity images. They don't.\r\n\r\nWebsites in the Amazon search index that admit that they do not own the rights to their content and typically have misappropriated Perfect 10 images or rights of publicity ","date_sent":"2005-03-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-03-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Perfect 10, Inc.","recipient_name":"Amazon.com, cc Google","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
