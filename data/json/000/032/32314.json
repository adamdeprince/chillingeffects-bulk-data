The charge=\r\nreimburses me for my valuable time, and for the unpleasant task of\r\ndoing=  something stupid (see below for explanation).  Address for\r\npayment: John=  Bryant, PO Box 66683, St Pete Beach FL 33736-6683. \r\n \r\nOther comments: \r\n \r\n* You will get no benefit from my removing the article, whereas if the=\r\narticle stays, you will have something that would direct people to your=\r\n\r\n website or otherwise get you some attention.  Now you will have\r\nnothing.   \r\n \r\n* Honoring your request means I will have to take my good time to\r\nsatisfy=  your inflated ego because it is 'your' article.  I mean, why\r\ndon't you get= \r\n out on the street and jump up and down and yell \"Mine!  Mine!  Mine!\"\r\n\r\n \r\n* For your information, I prefer to link rather than post on my site --=\r\nit's quicker (no loading) and I don't have to deal with\r\noverly-possessive=  copyright holders like you.  But when people don't\r\nsend me a link, I can't=  do that (Most of the things I post are things\r\npeople send me, your article=  being one).  So, as in your case, I post\r\nthe article. \r\n \r\n* People like you who ask to have their articles removed are invariably=\r\nfilled with the notion that they have written something of IMMENSE=\r\nimportance.  But 99 and 44/100ths percent of the time, what they have=\r\nwritten is of immense UNIMPORTANCE, and the fact that they are so=\r\npossessive of it merely shows their judgement is right down there in\r\nthe=  toilet with their article. \r\n \r\n* You should be honored that you got posted.  My site is one of the\r\nmost=  popular on the web, and I can post only a small portion of what I\r\nreceive.= \r\n  But I don't hear any thank-yous.   \r\n \r\n \r\n*********** REPLY SEPARATOR  *********** \r\n \r\nOn 12/29/06 at 9:52 PM Garry Vass wrote: \r\n \r\n>Hi,\r\n> \r\n>I run the Yaelf.com website and I refer to your page at \r\n>http://www.thebirdman.org/Index/Temp/Temp-SomeInterestingWordOrigins-Sc\r\n>roll=\r\nDownALittle-EH.htm \r\n> \r\n>Your content appears to have been lifted from my site.   \r\n> \r\n>Perhaps you were not aware of this, but in all cases I would ask that \r\n>you implement corrective measures and replace your content with a link \r\n>to the original site.\r\n> \r\n>Thanks in advance,\r\n>Garry","date_sent":"2006-12-30T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-12-30T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Garry","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
