We host and have been\r\nhosting through a number of servers over the past 4 1/2 years  weather\r\nrelated broadcasts/webcasts called \"The Barometer Bob Show\" and\r\n\"Hurricane Hollow's Eye on the Storm\". We are the sole owners,\r\nproducers, editors, and hosts of these internet based broadcasts. \r\n \r\nWe also own the copyrights and intellectual property also refered to as\r\nemminant domain associated with these broadcasts/webcasts, which include\r\nimages, recordings, domain names, ect. \r\n \r\nBased on the laws of the United States Copyright office, These shows are\r\nthe property of Hurricane Hollow Weather and Robert Brookens. These\r\nrecordings are a creation of , and have been produced by the above\r\nnamed. The recordings are the recorded voice of Robert Brookens (host),\r\nand the names of the host, sites owned by the host are mentioned\r\nthroughout these broadcasts. These recordings have also been published\r\non the internet. They have also been published on AM radio broadcasts\r\nprotected under FCC regulations. \r\n \r\nYour company, EV1Servers own two servers located in Houston, Texas that\r\nare being leased to and operated by NHCWX Data Services, also known as\r\nRadio.NHCWX.Com, HurricaneProject.Com, IPR365.Com, Storm2K.Org, and\r\nother domains that may be listed within the servers. They also claim to\r\nbe an affiliate with EV1Servers with your logo on their sites. \r\n \r\nThe IP Adresses are: \r\n \r\n216.127.92.122 \r\n \r\n66.98.250.79 \r\n \r\n66.98.250.79 \r\n \r\n66.98.251.192 \r\n \r\nAnd an unknown number of other IP Adresses. \r\n \r\nThe person that leases the servers from EV!Servers and that owns and\r\noperates these domains is: \r\n \r\nSteve Oliver \r\n \r\n203 James Court \r\n \r\nWinter Springs, Florida 32708 \r\n \r\nThese servers are currently allowing for download past recordings of\r\nwebcasts of the above mentioned shows. You can find the recordings here:\r\n\r\n \r\nhttp://www.radio.nhcwx.net/zina/index.php?p=InternetPartnershipRadioNetw\r\nork/RadioNHCWX/Cancelled%20Shows/2004%20Season  \r\n \r\nThe owner(s) of NHCWX Data Services have been notified three times in\r\nthe past to remove these recordings. This has been via email and phone. \r\n \r\nThe owner(s) of NHCWX Data Services did not remove them, but moved them\r\nto another location on one of two servers they are hosting their domains\r\non. This was to hide their exsistance on the servers. This shows intent,\r\nand shows their refusal to remove the said recordings. We have just\r\nlearned the recordings are still on the servers and have never been\r\nremoved. \r\n \r\nAlso, they are using an image to sell merchandise which is also\r\ncopyright protected under Hurricane Hollow Weather Corp, being it was\r\nproduced for and published by our company. You can find the merchandise\r\nhere: \r\n \r\n www.storm2k.org/wx/ sold via www.cafepress.com/storm2k.4893049  \r\n \r\non this merchandise, you can clearly see this image\r\nwww.hurricanehollow.org/images/hhwxlogo.gif  which is owned by Hurricane\r\nHollow Weather Corp. \r\n \r\nThis is a notification to EV1Servers that the recordings and images on\r\nthese servers leased to NHCWX Data Services, and that the servers be\r\nremoved immediatly. \r\n \r\nFurthermore, any rebroadcast, transmission, or copies that have been\r\nmade, sold for any reason should be deleted and/or returned to Hurricane\r\nHollow Weather Corp. \r\n \r\nThese include, copies that may be stored as backup on any other servers\r\nat EV1Servers. \r\n \r\nI am contacting your company directly in good faith. Your policy of\r\ncopyright infringment is clear (\r\nhttp://www.ev1servers.com/About/Aup.aspx ), and the owner(s) of NHCWX\r\nData Services are aware of the consequenses of knowingly storing and\r\nallowing for download copyright protected material on your servers. Let\r\nalone using a copyright protected image on merchandise for sale for\r\nprofit. \r\n \r\nWe request that the servers in question be removed immediatly, and the\r\nharddrives be held as evidence for 120 days, for possible future legal\r\nactions against NHCWX Data Services. The harddrives would show in the\r\nstatistics how many downloads have been peformed, ect. \r\n \r\nOtherwise, being this is a notification to EV1Servers in good faith, you\r\ncould be held equally libel for allowing the recordings of past\r\nbroadcasts/webcasts and images on merchandise to be downloaded and/or\r\nsold for profit, being EV1Servers is listed as an affiliate. Which\r\nHurricane Hollow Weather Corp is receiving no compensation for. Again,\r\nthis is a notification to EV1Servers of the copyright material on those\r\nservers.  \r\n \r\nNotification has been made to Steve Oliver and NHCWX Data Services in\r\nthe past, in which have been ignored. Any further notification to them\r\nwould harm any efforts of ours to pursue gathering of evidence for\r\nfurther actions to recover any profits received by them or for damages\r\nconcerning the copyright infringments by them. Including EV1Servers\r\ndisclosing the nature of the copyright infringments. We are contacting\r\nother companies concerning other copyright infringement and the\r\nmerchandise sales. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\nRobert Brookens \r\n \r\nPresident \r\n \r\nHurricane Hollow Weather Corp \r\n \r\n7401 East Ridge Estates Drive \r\n \r\nGlen Saint Mary, Fl 32040 \r\n \r\n904-563-4448 \r\n \r\nMIME element (text/html)\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\r\n<HTML><HEAD> <META http-equiv=Content-Type content=\"text/html;\r\ncharset=iso-8859-1\"> <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.2963\"\r\nname=GENERATOR> <STYLE></STYLE> </HEAD> <BODY bgColor=#ffffff><FONT\r\nsize=2> <P align=left><STRONG><FONT size=3>To:</FONT></STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><FONT\r\nsize=3><STRONG>EV1Servers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp\r\n;&nbsp;\r\nOctober 3, 2006</STRONG></FONT></P>\r\n<P align=left></FONT><FONT face=\"Times New Roman\"><STRONG>835 Greens\r\nParkway Suite 150<BR>Houston, Texas 77067</STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><STRONG>From:</STRONG></P>\r\n<P align=left><STRONG>Hurricane Hollow Weather Corp</STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><STRONG>7401 East Ridge Estates Drive</STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><STRONG>Glen Saint Mary, FL 32040</STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><STRONG>(904) 563-4448</STRONG></P> <P\r\nalign=left><STRONG>Dear EV1Servers,</STRONG></P> <P align=left><STRONG>I\r\nown Hurricane Hollow Weather Corporation.
