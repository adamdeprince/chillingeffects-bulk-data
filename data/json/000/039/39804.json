Since 1856, Western Union, through its\r\npredecessors, has used the WESTERN UNION Marks for various communication and\r\nfinancial services all over the world. Worldwide, Western Union owns over 720 U.S.\r\nand foreign registrations for the WESTERN UNION Marks and over 150 pending\r\napplications for the WESTERN UNION Marks.
