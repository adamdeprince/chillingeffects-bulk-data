As\r\nit stands today, it appears to me to strongly mislead potential\r\ncustomers by implying that by paying you, customers will have a better\r\nchance of getting a good article in Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nYou are inappropriately using our trademarks in commerce, and this must\r\nstop immediately.\r\n\r\nYou are not telling your potential customers that you have been banned\r\nfrom editing Wikipedia.\r\n\r\nThis is a friendly letter, I am open to discussing the possibilities\r\nhere.  I prefer that we resolve this amicably.  But I am cc'ing our\r\nlegal counsel, Brad Patrick, to let you know that we reserve all our\r\nrights to take legal action in the future.\r\n\r\n--Jimbo","date_sent":"2007-12-11T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-12-11T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"[Private]","recipient_name":"MyWikiBiz.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
