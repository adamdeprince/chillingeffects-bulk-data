Property\r\n\r\nDear google:\r\n\r\nI am writing this letter on behalf of Warner Bros.\r\nEntertainment Inc. (\"Warner Bros.\"), in response to the discovery of\r\ncopyrighted works from Warner Bros.' located at google. Specifically,\r\nwe note the unauthorized use therein of images and content from the\r\nfollowing Warner Bros. motion pictures and/or television programs:\r\n\r\nTitle: 300\r\nInfringement Source: Web\r\nInitial Infringement Timestamp: 5 Oct 2007 18:51:03 GMT\r\nRecent Infringment Timestamp: 5 Oct 2007 18:51:03 GMT\r\nInfringer Username:\r\nInfringing Filename:\r\nhttp://allmoviesreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/watch-300-full-length-movie-online-for.html\r\nInfringing Filesize: 1\r\nInfringers IP Address: 72.14.207.191\r\nInfringers DNS Name:\r\nInfringing URL:\r\nhttp://allmoviesreview.blogspot.com/2007/10/watch-300-full-length-movie-online-for.html\r\n\r\nThis material is infringing and should be removed or access to it disabled.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials\r\ndescribed above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not\r\nauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. The\r\ninformation in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of\r\nperjury, I declare that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner\r\nof an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. It is Warner\r\nBros.' position that google is not entitled to safe harbor under the\r\nprovisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Nonetheless, this\r\nnotice is styled - for your ease - as one you'd consider a 'take down\r\nnotice.'\r\n\r\nMaterial published by Warner Bros. is copyrighted and Warner Bros. has\r\nvaluable rights in and to such material, which rights are protected by\r\nlaw. Complete episodes and excerpts of such material and any other\r\nproperty of Warner Bros. may not be used without permission of Warner\r\nBros. The unauthorized use thereof by you and/or your website\r\nseriously compromises the interests of Warner Bros. in violation of\r\nWarner Bros.' federally protected rights. Warner Bros. must therefore\r\nact to protect our rights and prevent such unauthorized uses.\r\n\r\nWe hereby demand that you disable access to all such unauthorized\r\nWarner Bros. materials and cease distribution immediately, via all\r\nmeans, of all proprietary Warner Bros. materials. We further demand\r\nthat you agree to refrain from enabling further unauthorized use of\r\nproperties owned by Warner Bros. in any manner whatsoever.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, should you wish to discuss obtaining permission for the\r\nuse of material of a Warner Bros. property, you should contact Warner\r\nBros. for permission. Any such discussions regarding legitimate uses\r\nof Warner Bros. approved content are predicated upon immediate removal\r\nof unauthorized Warner Bros. material.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that Warner Bros. considers this a serious matter.\r\nAccordingly, we require that you comply with the foregoing demands by\r\nremoving the infringing material identified herein forthwith. Your\r\nfailure to respond to this matter as requested and/or any further\r\nunauthorized use of Warner Bros.' copyrighted materials may compel\r\nWarner Bros. to pursue more formal channels to protect its rights and\r\nthe integrity of its services.\r\n\r\nPlease note that nothing contained in this letter nor any act or\r\nomission to act by Warner Bros., its parents, subsidiaries and\r\naffiliates is intended or should be deemed to be a waiver or\r\nmodification of any rights or remedies which Warner Bros., its\r\nparents, subsidiaries and affiliates may have, and all such rights or\r\nremedies, whether at law or at equity, are hereby expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your prompt response to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[private]\r\nVice President, Anti-Piracy Internet Operations\r\nWarner Bros.
