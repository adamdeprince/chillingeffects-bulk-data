This letter is to notify you that the copyright of my article\r\n\"The British Royal Family\" has been infringed on Google Groups.\r\n\r\n1. The copyrighted work which has been infringed is my article \"The British Royal Family,\" which is published on my website at www.royalty.nu\r\n\r\n2. Google Groups members have copied the text of my article without my permission and published it on Google Groups at these message IDs :\r\n\r\n<253f8338.0407220651.1eb9d2fb@posting.google.com> \r\n<2majqmFkv4mOU1@uni-berlin.de>\r\n\r\nBoth these posters were replying to another poster who originally posted my article on Google Groups without my permission. In replying to him, they quoted his post, including my article. (I sent you a complaint last week about the copyright infringement in the original post.)\r\n\r\n3. My name is [private]. I can be contacted at: \r\n[private]\r\nCrystal River, FL 34428\r\nxxx-xxx-xxxx\r\ne-mail [private]@[private]\r\n\r\n4. The infringement appears on Google Groups, alt.gossip.royalty newsgroup.\r\n\r\n5. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\n6. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nPlease remove my article from Google Groups. Thank you for your help; I truly hope this is the last time I will have to complain about this ongoing problem. My signature is below.\r\n\r\n7.[private]","date_sent":"2004-07-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-07-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"www.royalty.nu","recipient_name":"Law Offices of Brian Schneider","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
