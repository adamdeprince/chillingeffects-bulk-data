I am\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of FUNimation Entertainment with respect to the\r\nmatters discussed herein.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFUNimation is a company engaged in the production of animated motion\r\npictures.  We own or control various exclusive copyrights and trademarks\r\nrelated to the animated motion pictures known as \"Basilisk,\" \"Trinity\r\nBlood,\" \"Speedgrapher,\" \"Tsubasa,\" and \"FullMetal Alchemist\" (collectively\r\nreferred to as the \"Properties\").  FUNimation holds exclusive rights to the\r\nProperties throughout the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other\r\nterritories.  Specifically, FUNimation is the exclusive licensee for\r\nproduction and distribution of home videos, DVDs, video CDs, and other home\r\nvideo formats and devices (hereafter referred to collectively as\r\n\"Videograms\") within the referenced territories.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur investigations reveal that a site for which your company provides\r\nservices is currently being used to sell and/or distribute unlicensed\r\ndownloads containing episodes, movies, or other embodiments of the\r\nProperties.  The use of the Properties in this manner is NOT authorized by\r\nFUNimation Entertainment and is a violation of FUNimation's intellectual\r\nproperty rights.  The specific site found to be in violation is\r\nHentaiCastle.net.
