(\"Chanel\"), in certain intellectual property\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nChanel is the owner of the world-famous CHANEL and CC Monogram\r\ntrademarks (the \"Chanel Marks\").  Chanel owns numerous trademark\r\nregistrations worldwide for the Chanel Marks.  These registrations\r\nconstitute conclusive evidence of our client's ownership of the Chanel\r\nMarks as well as Chanel's exclusive right to use these marks.  As a\r\nmatter of law, these trademark registrations are constructive notice to\r\nyour company of Chanel's rights in the marks.\r\n\r\nIt has come to Chanel's attention that your company provides web-hosting\r\nservices to the website www.shoesoffer.com and electronic mail\r\n(\"e-mail\") services to root@shoesoffer.com which are offering for sale\r\ncounterfeit Chanel goods.  This correspondence shall constitute express\r\nnotice to you that www.shoesoffer.com is using Chanel's famous name and\r\ntrademarks to divert traffic to the website in violation of multiple\r\ninternational criminal laws as well as civil laws regarding trademark\r\ninfringement, counterfeiting, and unfair competition.  Pursuant to these\r\nlaws, Chanel is entitled to extensive remedies, including preliminary\r\nand permanent injunctions, recovery of profits, treble damages, and\r\nattorney fees.  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Chanel requests your company cease providing web-hosting\r\nservices to the owner of the site that is accessed through the URL of\r\nwww.shoesoffer.com and \r\ne-mail services to root@shoesoffer.com.  Further, Chanel requests your\r\ncompany's written confirmation within two weeks of the date of this\r\nletter that it has removed or blocked access to the pages at\r\nwww.shoesoffer.com containing the Chanel name and marks and has ceased\r\nproviding e-mail services to root@shoesoffer.com.\r\n\r\nWe are authorized by Chanel to make this demand based upon its\r\ngood-faith belief that the above-identified website's use of the Chanel\r\nname and marks is not authorized by Chanel, its agents, or the law.  \r\n\r\nThis demand is made without waiver of any of Chanel's rights or\r\nremedies, all of which are expressly reserved.\r\n\r\nStephen M.
