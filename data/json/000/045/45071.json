The BODOG Mark is well-known and famous; it is used to provide online wagering & gaming services, gaming educational services, as well entertainment properties in various other fields. The BODOG Mark is used in (among others) the www.bodoglife.com and www.bodoglife.net Internet domain names, which are also well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has come to our attention that you are currently operating a web site at http://bodoglifepoker.com, a domain name that infringes the BODOG Mark (the \"Infringing Domain Name\"). You are using the Infringing Domain Name to redirect Bodog's existing and potential customers to the web site for your business purposes.
