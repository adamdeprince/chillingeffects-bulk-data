{"dmca":{"id":2447,"type":"Dmca","title":"Cease and Desist","body":"It has come to my attention that you have made an unauthorized use of my copyrighted work entitled Mac Whiz(the \"Work\") in the preparation of a work derived therefrom. I have reserved all rights in the Work, first published in July 25 1996. Your work entitled Mac Whiz is essentially identical to the Work and clearly used the Work as its basis.  \r\n\r\nAs you neither asked for nor received permission to use the Work as the basis for Mac Whiz nor to make or distribute copies, including electronic copies, of same, I believe you have willfully infringed my rights under 17 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. and could be liable for statutory damages as high as $150,000 as set forth in Section 504(c)(2) therein. \r\n\r\nI demand that you immediately cease the use and distribution of all infringing works derived from the Work, and all copies, including electronic copies, of same, that you deliver to me, if applicable, all unused, undistributed copies of same, or destroy such copies immediately and that you desist from this or any other infringement of my rights in the future. If I have not received an affirmative response from you by January 05, 2004 indicating that you have fully complied with these requirements, I shall take further action against you. \r\n\r\nVery truly yours, \r\n\r\nDerald Dutchak \r\n","date_sent":"2003-12-16T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-12-16T05:00:00Z","topics":["Derivative Works","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Derald Dutchak, Mac Whiz Computers","recipient_name":"MacWhiz Technologies","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
