I\r\nhave noticed that they are using copyrighted images (NFL Images) to\r\npromote their site. If you check   http://www.finheaven.com/wallpapers/\r\nyou will see that images taken from other sources have been used to\r\ncreate wallpapers promoting finheaven.com.  In fact, one such image\r\nhttp://www.finheaven.com/wallpapers/fullimages/28.jpg  is a copyrighted\r\nadvertisement for the Miami Dolphins. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n      This site should be asked to remove images that they do not own\r\ncopyrights for. In fact, they are claiming copyrights for the wallpapers\r\nwith this language :  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll images in this gallery are Copyright (c) 2005.\r\nThis means that: You are not allowed to copy the image\r\nand make it your own. You are not allowed to copy the image,\r\nthen make minor changes and then call it your own.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI find this quite humorous since the images were originally stolen from\r\nother sites in the first place. The site www.canesheaven.com\r\n<http://www.canesheaven.com/>  also uses copyrighted images in the\r\nheader. One would have to ask themselves, where did they acquire a\r\nphotographer's credential to get those shots? The answer is they didn't,\r\nthey stole the images.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGerard Fanner\r\n\r\nMember of the Professional Photographer's Association","date_sent":"2007-08-21T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-08-21T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
