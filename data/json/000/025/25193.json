Chanel owns numerous trademark\r\nregistrations worldwide for the Chanel Marks.  These registrations\r\nconstitute conclusive evidence of our client's ownership of the Chanel\r\nMarks as well as Chanel's exclusive right to use these marks.  As a\r\nmatter of law, these trademark registrations are constructive notice to\r\nyour company of Chanel's rights in the marks.\r\n\r\nIt has come to Chanel's attention that your company provides web-hosting\r\nservices to the website www.shoesoffer.com which is offering for sale\r\ncounterfeit Chanel goods.  This correspondence shall constitute express\r\nnotice to you that www.shoesoffer.com is using Chanel's famous name and\r\ntrademarks to divert traffic to the website in violation of multiple\r\ninternational criminal laws as well as civil laws regarding trademark\r\ninfringement, counterfeiting, and unfair competition.  Pursuant to these\r\nlaws, Chanel is entitled to extensive remedies, including preliminary\r\nand permanent injunctions, recovery of profits, treble damages, and\r\nattorney fees.  \r\n\r\nThe use of ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.'s web-hosting services\r\nby www.shoesoffer.com also violates your company's Acceptable Usage\r\nPolicy which states:\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Infringement Policy\r\n\r\nUsers may not transmit, distribute, download, copy, cache, host, or\r\notherwise store on a Server, The Planet Network or its physical\r\ninfrastructure any information, data, material, or work that infringes\r\nthe intellectual property rights of others or violates any trade secret\r\nright of any other person. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Chanel requests your company cease providing web-hosting\r\nservices to the owner of the site that is accessed through the URL of\r\nwww.shoesoffer.com.
