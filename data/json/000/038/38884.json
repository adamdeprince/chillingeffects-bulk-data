Templatemonster.com website content\r\ncannot be reproduced, copied, or edited in any manner or medium and is\r\ntherefore making you the possessor of illegal material. US copyright\r\nlaws protect all parts of this material. The owner of this website has\r\nbeen notified of his actions, and has been informed of the consequences.\r\nHe ignored a feedback request confirming that his site is illegal and\r\nhas failed the amicable case solution. \r\n \r\nHence, we demand the immediate removal of http://www.50dolares.com\r\naccount from your company server and the cease of distribution of any of\r\nour products IMMEDIATELY. \r\nWe have already notified our corporate lawyers of this situation and we\r\nwill not hesitate to exercise our legal right to pursue this matter in a\r\ncourt of law should you fail to meet our demand immediately. \r\n \r\nTemplatemonster.com is committed to investigating licensing infractions\r\nnot only to protect our own interests but to protect those of the\r\ndesigners who submit their designs to us as well. We are contractually\r\nobliged to protect the intellectual property rights and livelihood of\r\nthe artists whose work we license. While we support freedom of\r\nexpression, we must enforce our licensing conditions rigorously in order\r\nto meet our responsibilities. We feel that your cooperation regarding\r\nthis matter is fully warranted, and expect it will be promptly\r\nforthcoming. \r\n \r\nThank you and waiting for your prompt answer. \r\n----\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nRyan Cathcart\r\nLegal assistant\r\nArtvertex, Inc. \r\nTel:  15183208716\r\nFAX:  19175913014\r\nmailto:piracy@templatemonster.com \r\n \r\nnote: DMCA form complain and screenshot attached. \r\n \r\n              \r\nMIME element (application/pdf)\r\nMIME element (image/png)\r\nMIME element (text/plain)","date_sent":"2007-08-16T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-08-16T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Artvertex, Inc.","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
