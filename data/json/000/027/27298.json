Otherwise our client will have no option \r\nbut to include you in any legal proceedings which may become necessary. \r\n \r\n-----Original Message----- \r\nFrom: Adlex Solicitors [mailto:djg@adlexsolicitors.co.uk]  \r\nSent: 26 February 2007 15:08 \r\nTo: 'hasteshop@hotmail.com' \r\nSubject: runekeep.net \r\n \r\nDear Mr Ford \r\n \r\nwww.runekeep.net (?\"the Website?\") \r\n \r\nWe act for Jagex Limited. Our client has owned and operated RuneScape, the \r\nwell-known online multiplayer adventure game, at a website at runescape.com \r\nsince 2001. There are currently some 4.1 million active registered players \r\nof the game in over 15 countries. Our client?'s turnover in its last \r\nfinancial year to March 2005 was in excess of \u00a35 million (approximately $9 \r\nmillion).  \r\n \r\nOur client owns Community Trade Mark E2942761, UK Trade Mark 2302308 and US \r\nTrade Mark 2829952 for the word RUNESCAPE in classes 16, 25 and 41. Our \r\nclient also has common law rights (and/or under company name / unfair \r\ncompetition law or equivalent) in the name RUNESCAPE deriving from its \r\nextensive use outlined above.  \r\n \r\nWe understand that you are the owner / operator of the Website. This site \r\ninfringes our client?'s rights as follows: \r\n \r\nThe Website is being used to facilitate the offsite trading of RuneScape \r\nitems and accounts and the distribution of software robots and / or similar \r\nprograms (?\"bots?\") for the purpose of cheating (as well as related discussion \r\ngroups).  \r\n \r\nClearly you or persons authorised by you have used our client?'s site to \r\neffect these transactions and you have thereby become bound by - and \r\nbreached - our client?'s contract which strictly forbids such activities.  \r\n \r\nIn any case you have tortiously induced the other parties to break their \r\ncontracts with our client.  \r\n \r\nAmongst other things, real money trading carried out offsite enables some \r\nplayers to advance in the game by buying their way ahead. Bots also enable \r\nplayers to cheat at the game. Such activities spoil the game for the \r\nmajority of honest players who just want to play it for the fun and \r\nchallenge the game gives, if played fairly. Genuine players are deterred \r\nfrom playing. Consequently such transactions damage the game and cause our \r\nclient financial loss. \r\n \r\nBreaching our client?'s contract means that any use by you of our client?'s \r\nsite is unlicensed and thereby infringes our client?'s intellectual property \r\nrights in its site. Furthermore our client?'s contract confirms that all \r\nRuneScape characters and items are and remain our client?'s intellectual \r\nproperty.   \r\n \r\nBots infringe our client?'s copyright by copying and modifying our client?'s \r\nsoftware and/or by attempting to circumvent our client?'s copyright \r\nprotection mechanisms. Bots also constitute a trespass to chattels. \r\n \r\nThe transactions are criminal offences insofar at they incite, counsel, \r\nprocure or assist persons to gain unauthorised access to our client?'s \r\ncomputer systems. \r\n \r\nOur client?'s trade mark RUNESCAPE is being used on the Website in a manner \r\nwhich is not in accordance with honest practices in commercial matters and \r\nwhich without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the \r\ndistinctive character of the mark. This is trade mark infringement. \r\n \r\nPlease cease all activity outlined above within 7 days from today. Otherwise \r\nour client will have little choice but to initiate formal legal steps to \r\nprotect its position.  \r\n \r\nYours faithfully \r\n \r\nAdlex Solicitors \r\nwww.adlexsolicitors.co.uk \r\nTel: +44 (0) 207 317 8400 \r\nFax: +44 (0) 207 317 8405 \r\nMob: +44 (0) 7775 635 835 \r\n76A Belsize Lane, London, NW3 5BJ \r\n  \r\nThe sender does not guarantee that this message including any attachment is \r\nsecure or virus free.
