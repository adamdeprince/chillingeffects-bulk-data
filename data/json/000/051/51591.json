They are doing this to  \ncreate a false impression of eSources, because it exposed that  \ndropshipland.com, ukdropshipgroup.com, dpbuk.co.uk and dvddropship.com are  \nduplicate services owned by the same person.\nWe have tried to defend our service, however the owner of the forum is  \nanother intermediary dropshipper, colluding with the owner of  \ndropshipland.com to misinform resellers. Despite our attempts to explain  \nour service, the forum purposely banned our account and started posting  \nfalse allegations for personal gain and to deter resellers from a service  \nthat gives them lots more choice and therefore guides them to  \nprofitability. All the following comments are false or purposely fabricated.\n1. \u201cwaste of money\u201d\nThe poster of this comment has never tried our service. Also our real  \ncustomers differ significantly: https://www.esources.co.uk/premiumbuyer.php\n2. \u201cmost of them are already listed here in the above section\u201d\nThe eSources database features over 110,000 verified sources.","original_work_urls":[{"url":"https://www.esources.co.uk/premiumbuyer.php"}],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=esources+review&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
