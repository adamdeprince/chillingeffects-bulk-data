Its a clear copyright violation and should \r\nbe considered as warez. \r\n \r\nURL: \r\nTheir website: http://www.phpbbtheme.com/ \r\n \r\nWhere they stole it from: \r\nConundrum, Chairs: designed by mikelothar.com \r\nMorpheus, Aeolus, AcidTech: designed by me: phpbbstyles.com \r\nCharcoal, AirHead: designed by Zarron Media: zarron.com \r\netc..  everything is stolen. \r\n \r\nProofs: \r\n1. You can confirm authors for few styles at urls I provided \r\nabove. \r\n2. Some of designs are offered on phpbb.com with original \r\ndesigner's copyrights. You can find them here: \r\nhttp://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/catdb.php?db=2 \r\n3: Almost all of those designs are offered on phpbbhacks.com: \r\nhttp://www.phpbbhacks.com/templates.php \r\nYou can see designs with exactly the same names on that \r\nwebsite and by clicking on demo links you'll see correct copyright \r\nof original author, which has nothing to do with abuser's website. \r\n \r\nMore detailed proof: \r\nYou can confirm that designs are indeed stolen by downloading \r\nthem from abuser's website, unpacking and looking in file \r\n\"overall_footer.tpl\" (its a text file). You will see that they have \r\nreplaced designer's copyright with their own. \r\n \r\n \r\nWho am I, and why you should belive me instead of abuser: \r\nI'm former phpBB team member, which you can confirm on \r\nhttp://www.phpbb.com/about/ (I'm listed in \"Past Contributors\" \r\nsection) \r\n \r\nI have also informed other designers who's designs are stolen \r\nby abuser, so you can expect emails from them too, and in case if \r\nmy proof is not convincing enough I'm sure they'll provide \r\ndifferent proof. \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\nVjacheslav Trushkin.","date_sent":"2007-02-16T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-16T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
