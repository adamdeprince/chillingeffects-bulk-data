The IFPI is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies are 1,450 major and independent\r\nrecord companies in the US and internationally who create, manufacture and\r\ndistribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the\r\nIFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies in matters\r\ninvolving the infringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing\r\ntheir copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe believe your service is hosting the above-referenced site on its system.\r\nThis site, which we accessed on 03 March 2005 at 11:45 GMT, offers\r\napproximately 5 sound files for download.  Many of these files contain\r\nrecordings owned by one of our member companies, including songs by such\r\nartists as Kiss.

In addition, please inform\r\nthe site operator of the illegality of his or her conduct and confirm with\r\nIFPI, in writing, that this activity has ceased.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice.  In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement.
