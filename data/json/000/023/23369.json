I also can get you in contact with the\r\ndesigner of www.gamelinks.com, plus I have original Photoshop files of the\r\ndesign used, and my logo is featured on Elance.com under the designer's\r\nportfolio (to give further proof of who the web designer was, who in turn\r\ncan prove that this was designed solely for me).\r\n\r\nAny help in this matter (such as contacting the owner of\r\nhttp://www.bulletinboardforum.com and notifying him of this) would be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Maysonet\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-06-30T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-30T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Adam Maysonet","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
