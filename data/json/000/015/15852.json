There is much more that should be  \n\nremoved here - if not more or less the entire blog. However the above  \nposting is a serious concern as within this so called open letter The Pink\n \nPasty aka malcolm Lidbury aka Mal Corvus has blanked out all the names he \n\nhas written in this letter - HOWEVER it has now been bought to my\nattention  \nthat if you hold your mouse over the text and highlight the same - all  \nblanked out names can then be read - including the address and phone\nnumber  \nof the blogger himself - my name Jonathan Hodgetts and the organisation I \n\nrepresent The Pengersick Historic and Education Trust appear a couple of  \n\ntimes at least as do other people's names in full - This is clearly\nutterly  \nunacceptable and I insist you remove this posting with immediate effect - \n\nmaintaing this blogger by you is putting people's lives and businesses at \n\nrisk.\n\nJonathan Hodgetts\nChair Pengersick Historic and Education Trust","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://pinkpasty.blogspot.co.uk/?zx=9625f2db640459eb"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
