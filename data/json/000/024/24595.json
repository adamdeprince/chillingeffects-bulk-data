The Mi-ray hybrid roadster was developed at the GM Advanced Design Studio in Seoul. The Mi-ray (Korean for \u2018future\u2019), which celebrates brand\u2019s 100-year design heritage, combines superior hybrid propulsion technology and advanced styling. The Mi-ray is small and open like the 1963 Monza SS, and light and purposeful like the 1962 Corvair Super Spyder. Its aerodynamic fuselage is evocative of today\u2019s jet fighters.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://arts-post.blogspot.com/2011/04/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays.html"},{"url":"http://carbuildingz.blogspot.com/2011/04/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays.html"},{"url":"http://livingproper.com/2011/04/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays-tribute-to-brand%E2%80%99s-sports-car-heritage/"},{"url":"http://lux.chariweb.com/2011/04/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays.html"},{"url":"http://topgearnew.blogspot.com/2011/04/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.bornrich.com/entry/jet-inspired-chevy-mi-ray-concept-pays-tribute-to-brand-s-sports-car-heritage/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
