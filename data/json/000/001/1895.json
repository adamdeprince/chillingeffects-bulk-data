My material was published on the internet by my company, HQP / Hillman Quality Publications.\r\n\r\nI was relieved to learn that Google as a policy drops web pages that infringe on copyrighted material. I hope you do so in regards to the four infringing web pages listed below in bold. These four infringing web pages show up along with my copyrighted web page on Google's search results when a person conducts a search using unique phrases from my copyrighted web page.\r\n\r\nThe following three web pages contain verbatim entire paragraphs from my currently inactive website www.travelwonders.com - and the text and photos of travelwonders.com are still very much protected by my company's copyright. Note: 1 1/2 years ago I gave my wonder web site a new name (hillmanwonders.com) and used, revised and expanded the text that was on travelwonders.com for inclusion on hillmanwonders.com. Therefore, the three web pages listed below infringe on the copyright covering the material in both travelwonders.com and hillmanwonders.com.\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2003-07-21T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-07-21T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Hillman Quality Publications","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
