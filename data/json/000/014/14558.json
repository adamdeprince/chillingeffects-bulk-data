I am writing you because one or more of these issues on your local group still needs to be fixed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHere is a check list of how things need to appear on your local group's home page:\r\n\r\na)     Make sure that the local version of the logo you are using in no way obscures (covers up) the actual Freecycle(TM) logo itself. If it does, you can post the correct logo by copying it from Freecycle.org website. http://freecycle.org/images/logo.jpg  The logo must remain in the green color provided.  Please be sure that you have the current logo with the current copyright statement(2006) if your logo includes the copyright statement.\r\n\r\nb)     Make sure that any use of the phrase Freecycle is only as an adjective such as Freecycle members, etc. and is capitalized. We are *not* allowed to use it like this freecycling, freecycler, freecycled, freecyclin","date_sent":"2006-05-18T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-05-18T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"\"Freecycle(TM) Trademark Representative\" <trademark1@freecycle.org>","recipient_name":"ColumbiaCityFreecycle","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
