As you are the host site for\r\nthese disgusting pornography sites I would think that you would be very\r\nquick in making sure that they are dealt with.  Also, please note that\r\nthe imagery on the sites is obscene and no disclaimer or warning of\r\ncontent is offered.  I believe that this may also be a legal issue.\r\n\r\nwww.starznaked.com\r\nhttp://sex-cinema.net\r\nhttp://beingfucked.com\r\nhttp://xxlpenis.com\r\nhttp://sexvids.org\r\nhttp://pornvids.org\r\n\r\nIntellectual Property Infringement Policy (excerpted from The Planet\r\nAUP) Customers may not transmit, distribute, download, copy, cache,\r\nhost, or otherwise store on a Server any information, data, material, or\r\nwork that infringes the intellectual property rights of others.
