There are numerous GPL\r\nviolations on this site, namely removing the copyright in phpBB (the\r\nbulletin board) system's code, and i am sure that the copyright holders\r\nof the code will proceed with legal action. I am writing to you to\r\ninform you of slanderous and derogatory comments made against my person\r\non the site listed above. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.phpbb-mods.net/sutra4651.html#4651\r\n\r\nThe link i have provided above is the bulk of the slanderous and\r\ninsulting remarks made against my person. I'm sure you will agree such\r\ncomments as \"another retard from phpbb.com joining the debate here\" and\r\n\"MarkThehomo's\" are totally unacceptable to have on any site.\r\n\r\nAs well as emailing to abuse@theplanet.com i am also emailing to\r\nlegal-responce@theplanet.com, as i will be taking this further via legal\r\naction. I am well within my right to pursue the sites web host, and i'm\r\nsure you realize this and thus we agree to a solution which makes all\r\nparties happy. \r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark Barnes","date_sent":"2006-09-16T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-09-16T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Mark Barnes","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
