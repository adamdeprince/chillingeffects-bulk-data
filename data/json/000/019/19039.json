It was a clip of me appearing on the Today Show performing the Electric Slide...on stilts. A few weeks later I received the following notice from YouTube:\r\n\r\nThis is to notify you that we have removed or disabled access to the following material as a result of a third-party notification by http://the-electricslidedance.com claiming that this material is infringing:\r\n\r\nElectric Slide on Stilts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFEw3NgMPwM\r\n\r\nI thought the third party would come from NBC. But it did not. It was from [Sender], who claims to have invented the electric slide. Once again here is his website:\r\n\r\nhttp://the-electricslidedance.com\r\n\r\nCan he claim that me performing the electric slide on slilts is a copyright infringement? \r\n\r\nI can provide a video clip of my performance if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[Recipient]","date_sent":"2007-01-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"http://the-electricslidedance.com","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
