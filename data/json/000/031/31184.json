Owner of\r\ntiklaizle.com has stolen content (videos) from our site, and has published\r\nthem on his site without our consent. Even though we have repeatedly asked\r\nthe owner to remove this content from his site, he refused to do so. On top\r\nof refusing to take necessary actions, he also replied in a very rude manner\r\n(not to mention the curse words and swearing he used in his e-mails).\r\n\r\nIf you go to tiklaizle.com website, you can see the video playing on the\r\nindex page. If you look at this video file, you will see that it has our\r\nsite's logo (our site is located at: http://www.reklamlar.tv), and also you\r\ncan see our domain name very clearly at the bottom-right of the movie he\r\nplaced on tiklaizle.com. Furthermore, he stole multiple videos and he is\r\ndisplaying them one after another.\r\n\r\nAlthough all the communication between us and the owner tiklaizle.com is in\r\nTurkish, we can still present the e-mails between us if necessary.\r\n\r\nAs you know, he does not have a right to do so without our consent, and it\r\nis your responsibility to make sure that people do not commit illegal\r\nactions on your servers.\r\n\r\nCan you please take necessary steps to have him remove this content from his\r\nsite?\r\n\r\nThank you for your cooperation,\r\nReklamlar.tv\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFDztHwvK/XpJs6oyURAqqGAJ920J9GiJ1sm1Q8TFxoH7mEs24rVACfaPBm\r\nF7xKK2cD+rXYAUUlUrALljA=\r\n=Gh98\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2006-01-19T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-19T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
