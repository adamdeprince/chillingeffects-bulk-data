{"dmca":{"id":2173,"type":"Dmca","title":"Cease and Desist Notice","body":"      This is your final cease and desist notice on the removal of 'PRIMESOURCEHOSTING.COM DOM' on your server. We have sent over 3 emails, and I have personally called asking to remove this from your servers. I have emailed support, abuse, noc, webmaster, and corp email addresses, with no replies, or action taken. This is cleary a scam site running an obvious site template and links stolen from HostDime, using a program to scour our pages for input. As you can see at \"http://www.primesourcehosting.com/forums/index.html\" they made a copy of our dynamic php forums, and have saved it as HTML. There is no question that this has been copied directly from our website, and if this is not addressed in a week, we will be contacting a lawyer to seek lost funds due to this site. Feel free to email me at [private]@hostdime.com, or contact me at [private]. I am hoping I will hear from you\r\n\r\nThank You,\r\nLegal Department\r\nHostDime a division of World Web Technologies, Inc.","date_sent":"2003-10-12T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-10-12T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"HostDime a division of World Web Technologies, Inc.","recipient_name":"FAST.NET","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
