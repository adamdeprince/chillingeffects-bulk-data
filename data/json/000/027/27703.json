On our  \r\nwebsite eb-video.com we have detailed \r\nproof that we are the owners of the material. EB-Video com watersports \r\nproductions. Also we have attached to this mail various pages of their \r\nwebsite where they offer our products. Within the films there are also \r\nour copyrightremarks. \r\n \r\nSo You either take that site \"gayscatcinema\" of the server, or you'll  \r\njust be enclosed in the legal procedures to follow, thats up to you. \r\n \r\nBelow all the information you'll need. Plus attachments \r\n \r\nKind regards \r\n \r\nGilbert \r\neb-Video ( E & R scp.) \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\no whom it may concern and who is affected, \r\n \r\nwe are the owners of EB-Video.com, E & R scp., in Spain. \r\n \r\nOn your website gayscatcinema.com we have discovered several eb-video \r\nproductions \r\nthat are copyrighted by us - eb-video.com ( E & R scp., Spain). \r\n \r\nWe have made various captures, sent you those in a separate mail, but in\r\n\r\ncase your \r\nserver blocks those mails as considered spam here the mail comes without\r\n\r\nthe captures again. \r\nThe films are: \r\n \r\nP.Games    No.  3019 \r\nSkinMaker No. 3020 \r\nHeaven       No.  3021 \r\nP.United     No.  3022 \r\nP-Casting    No. 3023 \r\n \r\nYou offer them either to download for special prices or even as DVD and \r\nDVD-packages. \r\nAs you may imagine we were not delighted finding our valuable \r\nproductions right there on \r\nthe sales counter of your website;  so we checked further for as many \r\ninformations to gather \r\nas possible. \r\n \r\nTo make a long story short we ask you to immediately remove all content \r\nregarding eb-video \r\naltered or in orginal formats, in film or in pictures from all of your \r\nwebsites or shoppinglists. \r\nAlternatively we offer you to keep on selling the films via download for\r\n\r\na monthly charge of \r\n500 Euro - minimum 1 year (12months) fixed guaranteed.  The sales of \r\nDVDs or other hardware \r\nproducts is not allowed, unless you have purchased the original DVDs \r\nfrom us. \r\n \r\nPlease be so kind and make your decision within the next couple of days.\r\n\r\nOtherwise \r\nwe will not hesitate to forward all information we have gathered so far \r\nto your local \r\nplus federal authorities in all countries you have chosen to reside. \r\nThis would not be the first time during the last 7 years.  So we can \r\njust recommend you \r\nnot to try tricks on us now or in the future.  At the bottom of this \r\nmail we have added \r\ncontact-addresses etc. \r\n \r\nExpecting an immediate reaction \r\n \r\nsincerely \r\n \r\nGilbert \r\neb-video.com  ( E & R scp., Spain)        18.02.2007 \r\n \r\nL.A.
