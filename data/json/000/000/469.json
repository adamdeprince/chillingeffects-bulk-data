It has come to our attention that you have copied intellectual property, specifically photographs, from our client and used them for your own benefit without authorization, permission, or a license. Protection of intellectual property is a matter our client takes very seriously. I have enclosed the photographs where you even admit that the photographs were taken by Lynn Armonaitis and are under copyright protection. Amazingly, you still selected to use these pictures without authorization.\r\n\r\nSimply, this is a blatant case of copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nAlthough my client has considerable issues with your illegal actions, we are willing to resolve this matter without the necessity to resort to litigation under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n1) The websites containing the illegally copied material are immediately removed as of the date you receive this letter;\r\n\r\n2) The material misappropriated is immediately destroyed;\r\n\r\n3) Your written confirmation that no such copying or misappropriation of intellectual property rights will occur in the future; and\r\n\r\n4) Your payment of $1,500.00 to my client.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response within 14 days of this letter.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\n[Private]\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: Upstate Publications, LLC\r\n \r\ncc: [Private]\r\nJumpline.com, Inc.\r\n1679 Gateway Circle\r\nGrove City, OH 43123","date_sent":"2002-04-16T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-04-16T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":"McNair Law Firm, P.A.","principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"www.nobojo.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
