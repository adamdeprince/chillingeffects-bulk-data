We are enclosing a copy of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice that Charter received from the copyright holder which includes the specific allegation.\r\n\r\nUnder the DMCA, copyright owners have the right to notify Charter\u2019s register agent if they believe that a Charter customer has infringed on their work(s).  When Charter receives a complaint notice from a copyright owner, Charter will notify the identifiable customer of the alleged infringement by providing them a copy of the submitted DMCA notice.  As required by law, Charter may determine that the customer is a repeat copyright infringer and reserves the right to suspend or terminate the accounts of repeat copyright infringers.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this activity has occurred without your permission or knowledge by an unauthorized user, a minor who may not fully understand the copyright laws, or even as a result of a computer virus.  However, as the named subscriber on the account, you may be held responsible for any misuse of your account.  Please be aware that using Charter\u2019s service to engage in any form of copyright infringement is expressly prohibited by Charter's Acceptable Use Policy and that repeat copyright infringement, or violations of any other Charter policy, may result in the suspension or termination of your service.  You may view Charter's rules and policies, including Charter\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy, under the policies section of charter.com.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you take immediate action to stop the exchange of any infringing material. For additional information regarding copyright infringement and for a list of frequently asked questions, please visit charter.com/dmca.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions about this letter, you may contact us at 1-866-229-7286.  Representatives will be available to take your call Monday through Friday 8am - 8pm, Saturday and Sunday 8am - 5pm (CST).\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nCharter Communications Security Resolution Team\r\nhttp://www.charter.com/security\r\n\r\n\r\n--- The following material was provided to us as evidence ---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\n***NOTE TO ISP: PLEASE FORWARD THE ENTIRE NOTICE***\r\nJune 28, 2011\r\nRe: Notice of Unauthorized Use of Registered Copyrights Owned by Digital Sin Inc\r\nCase #: P5677156\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nThis notice is intended solely for the primary Charter Communications internet service account holder.
