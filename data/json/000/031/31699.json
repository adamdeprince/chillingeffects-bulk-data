Here are the particulars:\r\n\r\n> 1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on \r\n> behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nThis message contains my electronic signature.  I am the exclusive copyright\r\nholder of the work in question and therefore am authorized to act in this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n> 2. Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been \r\n> infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site \r\n> are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works\r\nat that site.\r\n\r\nThe particular copyrighted work is a photograph of a pet hamster.\r\nThe original work is located on my website at the following URL:\r\nPage: http://pyropus.ca/personal/pets/zena/page-05.html\r\nImage: http://pyropus.ca/personal/pets/zena/zena-wheel1.jpg\r\n\r\n> 3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or \r\n> to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or \r\n> access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably \r\n> sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.\r\n\r\nThe infringing copy of my work is here:\r\nhttp://www.focusonthebeach.com/images/zena-wheel1.jpg\r\n\r\n> 4. Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to \r\n> contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, \r\n> and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining \r\n> party may be contacted.\r\n\r\nName, address, phone number:\r\n\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n101 - 116 Research Drive\r\nSaskatoon, SK\r\nS7N 3R3\r\n(306) 382-4100 ext. 106\r\n\r\nEmail contact is preferred; you may reach me at this email address.\r\n\r\n> 5. A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that \r\n> use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by \r\n> the copyright owner, it's agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI have not authorized this use of my copyrighted work, and it is not\r\nauthorized by the law.  I thus have a good-faith belief that this is an\r\ninfringing copy of my copyrighted work.\r\n\r\n> 6. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, \r\n> and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized \r\n> to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly\r\ninfringed.\r\n\r\nThe information in this notification is accurate and made under penalty of\r\nperjury.  I am the copyright holder of the work in question, and therefore\r\nam authorized to act on my own behalf.\r\n\r\nI trust this is sufficient for you to take action.  I would like the\r\ninfringing work removed immediately, and a statement that the user will not\r\nbe permitted to re-post the offending work to the server in question.\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n--\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nCharles Cazabon\r\n<charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.org>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRFC822 HEADERS:\r\nReceived: from localhost ([127.0.0.1] helo=[216.185.111.52])\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com (envelope-from\r\nabuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com)\r\n        with esmtp (Exim)\r\n        id 1FA6wH-0006rJ-G7; Fri, 17 Feb 2006 08:50:29 -0600\r\nReceived: from mx01 ([172.16.214.180] helo=mx01.filter.theplanet.com)\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com (envelope-from\r\n        charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.org)\r\n        with esmtps (TLSv1:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:256) (Exim) id\r\n1FA6wG-0006r9-4O\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Fri, 17 Feb 2006 08:50:28 -0600\r\nReceived: from s010600c0f04a067d.ss.shawcable.net ([70.64.40.43]\r\n        helo=discworld.dyndns.org)\r\n        by mx01.filter.theplanet.com (envelope-from\r\n        charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.org)\r\n        with smtp (Exim) id 1FA6wA-000AEW-UH\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Fri, 17 Feb 2006 08:50:27 -0600\r\nReceived: (qmail 16116 invoked by uid 1000); 17 Feb 2006 14:50:48 -0000\r\nDate: Fri, 17 Feb 2006 08:50:48 -0600\r\nFrom: Charles Cazabon\r\n        <charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.org>\r\nTo: ThePlanet Abuse Desk <abuse@theplanet.com>\r\nMessage-ID: <20060217145048.GA16074@discworld.dyndns.org>\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii\r\nContent-Disposition: inline\r\nUser-Agent: Mutt/1.5.11\r\nReceived-SPF: none (mx01.filter.theplanet.com: 70.64.40.43 is neither\r\n        permitted nor denied by domain of discworld.dyndns.org)\r\n        client-ip=70.64.40.43;\r\n \r\nenvelope-from=charlesc-copyright-enforcement-theplanet.com@discworld.dyndns.\r\norg;\r\n        helo=discworld.dyndns.org; \r\nX-Spam-Level: ---------------------------------------------------\r\nX-Spam-Score: -102.5\r\nSubject: [ABUSE] Notice of copyright infringement\r\nX-BeenThere: abuse@lists.theplanet.com\r\nX-Mailman-Version: 2.1.7\r\nPrecedence: list\r\nList-Id: <abuse.lists.theplanet.com>\r\nList-Unsubscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=unsubscribe>\r\nList-Post: <mailto:abuse@lists.theplanet.com>\r\nList-Help: <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=help>\r\nList-Subscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=subscribe>\r\nSender: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\nErrors-To: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n","date_sent":"2006-02-17T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-02-17T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Charles Cazabon","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
