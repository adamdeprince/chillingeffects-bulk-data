The purloined information\r\nis then sent to an email account and, based on our investigation of similar\r\nschemes, used to steal accounts and commit other fraudulent acts including\r\ninternational credit card and wire fraud. \r\n\r\nThis matter is urgent - we believe that consumers have been falsely directed\r\nto this page and may be fooled into divulging personal information to a\r\ncriminal, if the page is not immediately disabled. We ask that you\r\nimmediately disable the site at\r\nhttp://69.56.173.96/PayPal.com/us/cmd-run=/login.htm, as well as any\r\nassociated email addresses, so that this fraudulent scheme can be stopped.\r\nWe further request that you provide us with all contact information that you\r\nhave for this user so that we may provide this information to the proper law\r\nenforcement authorities. \r\n\r\nWhile we believe that the above information gives your company more than a\r\nsufficient basis for disabling the page immediately, out of caution we note\r\nthat your user's unauthorized reproduction of PayPal's trademark and\r\ncopyrighted materials violates federal law, and places an independent legal\r\nobligation on your company to remove the offending page(s) immediately upon\r\nreceiving notice from PayPal, the owner of the copyrighted materials.\r\nAccordingly, the information below serves as PayPal's notice of infringement\r\npursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Section 512\r\n(c)(3)(A): \r\n\r\nI, the undersigned, CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that I am the agent\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of the owner of certain intellectual property\r\nrights, said owner being named PayPal, Inc. I have a good faith belief that\r\nthe website located at URL\r\nhttp://69.56.173.96/PayPal.com/us/cmd-run=/login.htm has its copyright in\r\neach page of its website and associated source code. Please act\r\nexpeditiously to remove or disable access to the material or items claimed\r\nto be infringing. \r\n\r\nWe sincerely appreciate your immediate attention to this important matter.\r\nWe would also appreciate if you would take steps to confirm the accuracy of\r\nany contact information that your user may have provided to you in\r\nestablishing the account. Should you have any accurate information that\r\ncould assist PayPal and law enforcement in tracking this individual, we\r\nwould greatly appreciate your assistance, as we know that you do not condone\r\nthe use of your services for such criminal purposes.\r\n\r\nFinally, please be advised that we have referred this issue to the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation for their investigation.  The F.B.I. has requested\r\nthat we convey to you in this message their request that you preserve for 90\r\ndays all records relating to this web site, including all associated\r\naccounts, computer logs, files, IP addresses, telephone numbers, subscriber\r\nand user records, communications, and all programs and files on storage\r\nmedia in regard to all Internet connection information, pursuant to 18\r\nU.S.C. section 2703(f). While we do not act as an agent of the FBI in\r\nconveying this request, we do intend to fully cooperate with their\r\ninvestigation, and encourage you to do so as well.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this very serious matter, \r\n\r\nMisty D.
