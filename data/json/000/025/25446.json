At that time, you indicated\r\nthat it was no\r\nlonger on your website, which, at that time, was true.  However, I was\r\njust informed by\r\nmy client that it was placed there again and is currently there now,\r\nunder the exact same\r\nURL where it was previously. \r\n\r\n     We would like to know who is continuing to put the copyrighted work\r\non your\r\nwebsite.  Is it you?  If so, we are asking you to remove it and for your\r\nISP,\r\nTheplanet.com, to note your file accordingly.\r\n\r\n     To remind you, our office represents the L. Ron Hubbard Library,\r\nthe owner of\r\nthe copyright to a video work entitled \"Orientation.\"  This work is\r\nregistered with the\r\nUnited States Copyright Office under registration number PA 804-464.\r\n\r\n     The URL where this work can be found is:\r\n\r\n     http://www.planetvids.com/html/Scientology-Orientation-Film.html\r\n\r\n   \r\n     Under 17 U.S.C. \u0015 106, it is unlawful to reproduce or distribute\r\nsomeone else's\r\ncopyrighted work without that person's authorization.   Accordingly, I\r\nam asking for\r\nyour help in removing this copyrighted work from your service a second\r\ntime.\r\n     \r\n     I have a good faith belief, and in fact know for certain, that the\r\nposting of this\r\nwork through your system was not authorized by my client, any agent of\r\nmy client, or\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n     I declare under penalty of perjury that this information is\r\naccurate and that I am\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of the L.
