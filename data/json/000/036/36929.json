I was recently hired by\r\nApexSearchEngineMarketing.com, which is hosted on your servers, to design a\r\nweb site for him.  He's written to me to inform me that he has no intention\r\nof paying me for my work. I deleted the site from his servers, and he put it\r\nback and changed the FTP information and further informed me - again in\r\nwriting- that he had no intention of paying for use of the graphics and\r\nlayout design.  Basically, I have written proof that this man is using your\r\nhosting services for theft and copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nI am happy to forward all email and correspondence between us with full\r\nheaders. I am confident that using your servers to house copyright\r\ninfringing articles - which make you guys liable too - is firmly against\r\nyour policies. You can look on your server files that the part about me\r\nuploading things yesterday and then deleting, then him changing the FTP info\r\nand reuploading are all true.\r\n\r\nPlease advise what I can do to help you look into this matter. I am a\r\nlow-income single mother that works freelance web design to support myself\r\nand my severely disabled small child; he didn't owe me very much money\r\n($200) but it's a lot of money to ME, and I'd like to know that I have some\r\nrecourse for this bald-faced horrible behavior.\r\n\r\nI thank you in advance for any help.\r\n\r\nAndrea La-Rosa\r\nhttp://www.alrgroup.com\r\n786-290-8410\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD4DBQFCf2revK/XpJs6oyURAjj5AJdpFxJBghLU3ELf1sM5Vy9kYB1yAJwI3f71\r\n5GtLGl0+tteIBEinY52Q9A==\r\n=EjXQ\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-05-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"http://www.alrgroup.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
