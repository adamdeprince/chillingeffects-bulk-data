Also,\nthough  \nI do not have an android device and can therefore not see what else is in \n\nthis developer's app, it is clear from his screenshots that he is using at\n \nleast a couple of icons which are also found in our app.  Some of the\nicons  \nwe used are public domain; others were designed by us and are subject to  \ncopyright.  I would like to ensure that this developer did not copy any of\n \nthe icons we designed.\n\nNote: We clearly hold no copyright on the \"Keep Calm and Carry On\" poster \n\nor the concept of an app which allows users to customize it.  However, the\n \nuse of the \"undead hordes\" design is a clear infringement, and could lead \n\nconsumers to believe they are purchasing an app developed by us. In  \naddition, we have been developing an Android version of our top-selling\niOS  \napp as well.  Finally, given what I can see in the screenshots, I am  \nconcerned there may be further infringement within this app.","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
