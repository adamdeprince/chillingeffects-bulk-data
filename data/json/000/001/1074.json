The work in question is the entire website www.vintagelightingfixtures.com. The website was\r\n    originally designed by my company, SG Design Group and is presently being used by Vintage\r\n    Lighting Fixtures without our consent or authorization and without payment in full for past\r\n    graphic and website services rendered.\r\n    \r\n    2. The entire website www.vintagelightingfixtures.com.\r\n    \r\n    3. I can be reached at SG Design Group [private] Spring Valley, NY 10977.\r\n    [private]\r\n    [private]\r\n    \r\n    4.
