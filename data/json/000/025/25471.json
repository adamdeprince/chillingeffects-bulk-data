This serial *STALKER\r\n*[he \r\nhas others before me--details available] is one *Brian L. CROW*,\r\nAmerican \r\nradio-amateur call-sign *K3VR*, who 'hides' in the vicinity of\r\nPittsburgh, \r\nPA and interchangeably uses: \r\n \r\n   - Irwin, \r\n   - N. Huntington, \r\n   - Monroeville, \r\n   - Washington and Pittsburgh \r\n \r\nas his supposed *contemporaneous* places of residence, with all that \r\nimplies.... \r\nBrian CROW has among many, many other misdeeds, mis-appropriated my\r\nproper \r\nname/identity in made up e-mails, set up *obscene/Neo-NAZI Websites* 'as\r\nif' \r\nby me, runs several ~anonymous and quasi-overt webpages against me, has \r\nlabelled me a \"terrorist\", etc., etc. \r\n \r\n*Brian CROW has in the past year+ put up DOZENS of fraudulent websites,\r\nsuch \r\nas this--using aliases of both genders and even 'as if' a homo-sexual\r\nnamed \r\n\"MAN\"--faster than I have been able to have them taken down....* \r\n \r\nFYI--*lest you under-rate the seriousness of this*--our Police have had\r\nan \r\nopen *Criminal file* on this individual for more than a year.

But, what do I know about such cybergames.... \r\n \r\nTom *\"ku4my\"* is real--and is a *fellow mischief-maker with Brian CROW*\r\non \r\nthe Internet. Half a year ago Brian \"listed\" me on eBay--and Tom\r\n\"bought\" me \r\nfor some token amount--check with eBay! I'm reticent to even mention\r\nthese \r\nchildish games by my fellow radio-amateurs, except that they do show the\r\n\r\nbehind-the-scene *connection*, the fact that they break rules regularly \r\n[it's illegal generally and on eBay specifically to \"sell\" humans], as\r\nwell \r\nas their general MO. \r\n \r\nBTW \"ku4my\" refers to MySpace and Brandon, call-sign kc0uws. It so\r\nhappens \r\nthat *Brian CROW is well known at MySpace* [he put up the * \r\nhomo-erotic/Neo-NAZI* webpage 'as if' by me, referred to earlier, *which\r\nwas \r\nsubsequently taken down by MySpace/my Police*]. \r\n \r\nMoreover, Brian CROW recently fraudulently re-posted a so-called\r\n\"terrorist\" \r\nvideo of me, which had previously been taken down by YouTube, *under the\r\n\r\nfalse call-sign KC0UWS*.... Evidence of this is still visible on the \r\nInternet. Alternately, contact Brandon *via* the CC e-mail address,\r\nabove, \r\nor YouTube.... \r\n \r\n*You should have 'the picture' by now....* \r\n \r\nBy the way, I tried to find your *Terms Of Service* within which to\r\nanchor \r\nthis Abuse Complaint, but without avail.... \r\n \r\nIn closing, suffice it to say that this is a personal *VENDETTA* &\r\n*STALKING \r\n* and *via* the Links, *Incitement to STALK* by Brian CROW and *NOT a \r\ndiscussion group* or what have you.... \r\n \r\nI therefore ask [read \"*DEMAND*\" if it helps] that: \r\n \r\n   - you *REMOVE this Topic in its entirety* as well as any \r\n   spinoffs/caches thereof, \r\n   - institute measures to *ensure that Brian CROW & Co. do NOT\r\nresurrect \r\n   it* in another guise/using other aliases, as has been his\r\ndemonstrated \r\n   MO elsewhere on the Internet now for years, and \r\n   - that you *consider putting Brian CROW and/or whoever the culprit\r\nmay \r\n   be on an industry-wide \"Watch List\"*, otherwise he/his ilk will cause\r\n\r\n   you untold trouble and expose you to legal liability.... \r\n \r\nRSVP if you have any questions. \r\n \r\n*Time is of the essence....* \r\n \r\nYours truly, \r\n \r\n** \r\n*Karol F.
