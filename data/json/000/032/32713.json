I have tried to email the domain\r\nowner at the email in the registrar's record and the email addresses\r\nprovided on his website, but all the emails came back to me with failed\r\ndelivery. I have tried to track the hosting company for that website but\r\nhave failed to do so as clientnshosting.net has no contact information.\r\nHowever, in the traceroute I have encountered the reverse of theplanet.com.\r\nCould you please tell me if wobbilisim.com is currently hosted by you and if\r\nso, could you please ask your client to kindly remove the ripp-off\r\nimmediately so that he won't put himself  and you in an uncomfortable\r\nsituation?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nEmma Dobrescu\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
