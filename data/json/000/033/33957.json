My name is Steve \r\n, and my business partner and I (Jay) are the owners of a federally\r\nincorporated site (with trademarks in Canada and the USA) called\r\nBlackSun Inc.  We were recently alerted of a site that you host, which\r\nhas taken the (copyrighted) design of our website.\r\n\r\n        If you browse to http://www.sunusb.com  (hosted on your ip\r\naddress of 70.87.99.210), you will see the similarity to our website at\r\nthe link of http://www.blacksun.ca  .\r\n\r\n        Matt had mentioned that this hosted on one of your reseller\r\naccounts, so if you can kindly give him the heads up to contact his\r\nclient asap, that would be great.  We were unsuccessful in contacting\r\nthe sunusb.com person, as he appears to have an unlisted (domains by\r\nproxy type) phone number.  We would obviously like to see this content\r\nremoved at your earliest convenience.\r\n\r\n        If there is anything else that you need, please don't hesitate\r\nto call or email us.\r\n\r\n        -Steve Rogoschewsky\r\n        http://www.blacksun.ca\r\n        Suite 201\r\n        116 Research Drive\r\n        306-933-9814","date_sent":"2006-10-05T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-10-05T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"http://www.blacksun.ca","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
