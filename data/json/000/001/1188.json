{"dmca":{"id":1188,"type":"Dmca","title":"Is This Boost Busted?","body":"Dear Sir or Madam,\r\nIt has come to our attention that your company is using the term 'hydroboost\" as a component of your internet domain name(s) and in the sale and marketing of vehicle braking systems. We request that you immediately cease and desist from using 'hydroboost', and/or any other marks similar thereto, in this manner.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that Robert Bosch Corporation and its parent company, Robert Bosch GmbH, have been using the HYDRO-BOOST trademark to identify vehicle braking systems for over 25 years. Additionally, our company holds a federal trademark registration for HYDRO_BOOST covering said products (Registration No. 2,625,147). Your use of 'hydroboost\", a term that is confusingly similar to our HYDRO-BOOST trademark, is a violation of our trademark rights and is damaging the reputation and good will associated with this trademark.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm your intention to stop this unauthorized activity by signing below and returning this letter to me by February 1, 2003. We will be checking in the near future to ensure that the term 'hydroboost\" has been removed from the aforementioned domain name(s). If we find that you are still using this term as a component of the aforementioned domain name(s) or in the sale and marketing of vehicle braking systems, we will be forced to consider the legal remedies we have available, including injunctive relief and money damages.","date_sent":"2003-01-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-01-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Robert Bosch Corporation","recipient_name":"Hydratech Braking Systems","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
