{"dmca":{"id":14011,"type":"Dmca","title":"1st request melbournefloridafreecyclers","body":"Dear Owner of the Yahoo group \"melbournefloridafreecyclers\",\r\n\r\nI'm writing on behalf of The Freecycle Network(TM) to notify you that \r\nyour group is not an official Freecycle group and therefore does not \r\nhave permission to use the trademarked Freecycle name or logo or the \r\ncopyrighted materials provided in the Start-a-Group process or the \r\nfreecycle.org web site, or any confusingly similar derivations thereof. \r\n\r\nThe list of all local groups is available on The Freecycle Network's \r\nweb site at www.freecycle.org.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your enthusiasm very much and hope that you will become \r\nan active member of your closest existing Freecycle group.  We have \r\ninvested considerable time and resources in insuring that our \r\norganization is associated with only appropriately moderated, legal, \r\nand totally free services that have a common source of origin from The \r\nFreecycle Network.  This is why we only allow one group per community \r\nto avoid any confusion among the public as to with whom they are \r\ndealing when the Freecycle name is used.  Accordingly, please consider this your official notice to stop using the trademark-protected Freecycle name and logo, as well as any and all copyrighted texts, graphics, rules, and guidelines, in any part of the group including the title, or its URL (Yahoo group name).\r\n\r\nPlease understand that our intent is not to stop your or your group \r\nfrom recycling or exchanging unwanted items with fellow users.  Should you wish to remain independent of our organization, you are; of course, free to operate your own gifting-based site under a name that is not confusingly similar to Freecycle.  However, if there is another group listed on www.freecycle.org that covers the area that your group hoped to serve, please consider offering your help to that group as a \r\nco-moderator instead.  We can all use the help!\r\n\r\nIf you decide to join our organization instead of changing your group's name, you may wish to send a message to your group informing them of the existing Freecycle group(s) in your area (accessible via \r\nwww.freecycle.org) and asking them to join the group nearest to their \r\nhome or workplace.\r\n\r\nIf you decide instead to continue operating your own site outside of \r\nthe Freecycle Network, it is important to provide a calm and smooth \r\ntransition so that no members of either group are lost or become \r\nfrustrated by the process.  If the moderators of both groups are \r\ncareful, this will not be a problem.  Therefore, please let your users \r\nknow that your group name will be changing and they will have a week to be sure that any and all use of any Freecycle materials, marks, and \r\nlogo are completely removed from any sites affiliated with your group.\r\nThank you for all the good you have done and surely will continue to \r\ndo.\r\n\r\nIf you need any help in this process, please don't hesitate to contact \r\nme.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n \r\nJeanette\r\nTrademark Representative\r\nFreecycle.org\r\ntrademark1@freecycle.org","date_sent":"2006-08-10T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-08-10T04:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Jeanette:  Trademark Representative Freecycle.org","recipient_name":"Melbourne Fl Freecyclers","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
