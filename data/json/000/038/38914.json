The blogger is also  \nimpersonating me using my first and last name with the URL and pretending \n\nto be me when they are not.  They are misleading internet readers by using\n \nmy first and last name to that blogger account and pretending to be me and\n \ncopying my images.  Also the blogger claims they own the copyrights to an \n\nimage of a man on a podium but a software called TINEYE shows the blogger \n\ndoes not own the rights to the image. The image is available on nine other\n \nwebsites on the internet.  My father,  Bailey M. Bircheat is not this  \nblogger's father and this blogger does not have a birth certificate  \nverifying this information as such. Also this blogger does not have a  \ndriver's license to verify they are Diane Gerrish.  They are impersonating\n \nme by using my first and last name to mislead internet readers.  Please  \ndelete my image from this blogger's account.
