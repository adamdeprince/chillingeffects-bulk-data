Therefore, this was a trademark infringement for which you were directly responsible.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you are still in violation of the Federal Trademark laws, specifically, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (15 USC 1125(d)). This Act states in part that a person shall be liable in a civil action to the owner of a mark if that person registers a domain name in bad faith that is identical to the owner's mark.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on behalf of my client, I demand that you immediately give up any domain name using the FALCONEIRI CONSTRUCTION or any close variation thereof.\r\n\r\nIfyou immediately give up all rights to PALCONEIRICONSTRUCTION.COM, my client will consider the matter settled. If you do not give up the domain name, my client will take action in the Federal District Court against you for the previous trademark infringement and for continuing cyberpiracy. \r\n\r\nIf you wish to settle this amicably, please contact me within ten (10) days providing me with evidence that you have given up the domain name.\r\n\r\nThis letter is written without prejudice to any claim for damages or other relief which my client may have in the event that litigation proves necessary.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[private]\r\n\r\nBy First Class Mail and\r\nCertified Mail, Return Receipt Requested\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-09-26T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-09-26T04:00:00Z","topics":["ACPA","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Falconeiri Construction, Inc.","recipient_name":"Gripes and Grumbles, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
