We believe these sites are presenting false and misleading content and is infringing on our copyrighted website information. We request that you review these sites and remove them from the Google search results.\r\n\r\n(1) Our Copyrighted material is located here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.databasesystemscorp.com\r\n\r\n(2) The offending websites and pages containing our copyright material are listed below. All of these pages re-direct users to different pages within the different websites, thus the content of the pages viewed by the user is not what the Google search engine sees when it spiders these pages. Our content is not maintained on the user viewed pages, only on the spidered pages. (the user viewed pages contain virtually identical content other than the language).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThe following documents the copyright infringement and false promotion and misrepresentation by the owner of the following websites (VocalCom). The website owner is a foreign corporation headquartered in Paris, France, but has offices in the US. The US office address and phone number are included above.\r\n\r\n29 Identified Web Pages Containing Our Copyrighted Information\r\n\r\nhttp://www.callcentersolution.com\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialer.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialers.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/ telemarketing/telemarketing-software.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-automatic-dialer.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialer.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialers.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/ telemarketing/telemarketing-scripts.html\r\nwww.callcentersolution.com/ telemarketing/telemarketing.html\r\nhttp://www.vocalcom.com\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialers.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialer.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-automatic-dialer.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-software.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ telemarketing-scripts.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/telemarketing.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialer.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.com/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialers.html\r\nhttp://www.vocalcom.de\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialers.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/ telemarketing-auto-dialer.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/ telemarketing-software.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/telemarketing.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialers.html\r\nwww.vocalcom.de/telemarketing/ outbound-telemarketing-dialer.html\r\nhttp://www.vocalcom.be\r\nhttp://www.vocalcom.fr\r\nwww.vocalcom.fr/telemarketing/telemarketing.html\r\nhttp://www.vocalcom.it\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the above websites and pages include an archived copy (taken from our website in 2004) of our copyrighted website information maintained on the HOME page of Database Systems Corp.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.databasesystemscorp.com\r\n\r\nA copy of this archive can be provided if necessary but it is sufficiently close enough in content to our current version for a reasonable person to deduce that the content in the vocalcom.com and callcentersolution.com web pages was derived from this archive. VocalCom attempted to perform a global change of our name to theirs but failed to change OUR phone number contained in these offending pages.\r\n\r\nVocalCom appears to have used 2 different re-directed page formats, each one containing copyrighted information from our HOME page. The following are links to the Google cache of these pages as of 14 June 2005.\r\n\r\nhttp://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:HtU88AUz7ykJ:www.vocalcom.it/+&hl=en\r\n\r\nhttp://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:ZAaur-kDSzcJ:www.callcentersolution.com/telemarketing/outbound-telemarketing-dialer.html+%22Pacer+Predictive+dialer%22&hl=en\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF GOOGLE SEARCH\r\n\r\nThe following is one example of how this website owner is falsely representing VocalCom.
