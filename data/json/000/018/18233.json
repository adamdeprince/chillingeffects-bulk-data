In the event  \nthat this does not resolve the problem immediately, We will be filing a  \ncopyright infringement (or any other legal action possible) against\nGoogle,  \nfor continuing to inaccurately list our location knowingly.\n\nI can be contacted at b3nwatt@gmail.com,  ben@trutone.ca, or Tues - Sat  \n10:00am - 6:00pm EST @ 905-270-3440.\n\nWe are treating this as a very serious problem, and will follow up with\nthe  \nmatter in due course.\n\nWe believe that it is the responsibility of Google to verify it's\nlistings,  \nand be available to business owners to address errors such as this.  We  \nwould not be the first to complain about the inconsistent approach Google \n\ntakes towards customer service and error correction.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://maps.google.ca/maps/place?cid=5959519356356681765&q=trutone&hl=en&ved=0CDAQ-gswAQ&sa=X&ei=pooPTs-PNYvgNYfL9IEP"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
