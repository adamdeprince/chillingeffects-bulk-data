Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been \r\ninfringed.\r\n    \r\nInsider TA TM (Copyright(C)1995-2002, Stock Blocks, Inc.) is investment software for stock traders, operating on the Windows 9x/Me/2000/NT/XP platform. We have advertised in several trade publications over the past eight years, as well as being the topic of several software reviews, both web-based and in print. Insider TA is also sold on our web site at http://www.stockblocks.com.\r\n    \r\nThe copyrighted work at issue are [sic] various newsgroup spams that appear in \r\nhttp://groups.google.com/groups.\r\n    \r\n2. Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above.\r\n    \r\nUsing Google's Advanced Search, I searched groups for the phrase \"Insider TA\" from Jan. 1, 2001 to the present day. The results show 5 listings, all of which are posts by one bootlegger who uses the anonymous email guess201@hotmail.com with various aliases:\r\n    \r\nPosted by \"Vent\", Insider TA is included in his list for CD#3...\r\n    \r\no http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Insider+TA%22&hl=en&lr=&ie= UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=2001&as_maxd= 12&as_maxm =ll&as_maxy=2002&selm= anpjv4%24117ie%241%40ewald.scvmaxonline.com.sg&rnum=1\r\n    \r\nPosted by either \"Vent\", \"GueZsTrader\", and \"GueZs\", the following spams show Insider TA at the top of his list...\r\n    \r\no http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Insider+TA%22&hl=en&lr=&ie= UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny=2001&as_maxd = 12&as_maxm=11&as_maxy=2002&selm= amjtpu%24soaa%241%4Oengel.scvmaxonline.com.sg&rnum=2\r\n    \r\no http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Insider+TA%22&hl =en&lr=&ie= UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=1&as_minm =1&as_miny=2001&as_maxd =12&as_maxm=11&as_maxy =2002&selm=9seOnj%24n5u%241%40newsie.singa.pore.net&rnum=3\r\n    \r\no http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Insider+TA%22&hl=en&lr=&ie =UTF-B&as_drrb=b&as_miind=1&as_minm=1&as_miny =2001&as_maxd =12&as_maxm=11&as_maxy=2002&selm =9r7sel%24p7f%241%40newsie.singa.pore.net&rnum=4\r\n    \r\no http://groups.google.com/groups?q=%22Insider+TA%22&hl=en&lr=&ie =UTF-8&as_drrb=b&as_mind=l&as_minm=1&as_miny =2001&as_maxd=12&as_maxm=ll&as_maxy =2002&selm =9qpb72%24oqf%241%40newsie.singa.pore.net&rnum=5\r\n\r\nDMCA complaint - Stock Blocks, Inc. - Newsgroup postings by bootlegger\r\n    \r\n3.
