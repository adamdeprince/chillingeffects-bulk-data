You admit that it meets some of the criteria and\r\nit most certainly breaks many other international copyright agreements\r\nother than the DMCA.\r\n\r\nWhat does a site have to do to warrant attention? The site uses\r\nvirtually the same name as us and has ALL of our archived material, plus\r\nlogo. The site even uses our full names on the front page! If that is\r\nnot a 'substantive merit' then what is?\r\n\r\nWe are an online magazine, which means that we have responsibility to\r\nour contributors to protect their Intellectual Rights and a site such as\r\nthis is the antithesis of what we stand for.\r\n\r\nAsa Butcher\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cover every issue...every day\r\nwww.ovimagazine.com\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Response wrote: \r\n\r\n        To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        Please note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice\r\ndoes not substantially comply with the required notification elements of\r\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        Please note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of\r\nyour claim.\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        Please visit our web site at www.theplanet.com/legal\r\n<http://www.theplanet.com/legal> .\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        Legal Response Team\r\n\r\n        THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\n        From: Asa Butcher [mailto:asa@chameleonproject.net] \r\n        Posted At: Tuesday, September 05, 2006 7:32 AM\r\n        Posted To: Legal Response\r\n        Conversation: Breach of copyright\r\n        Subject: Breach of copyright\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        5 Sept, 2006\r\n        Dear Sir/Madam,\r\n        \r\n        It has come to our notice that one of your customers\r\n(www.playarta.com, www.wexico.com, www.oviwebdevelopment) has recently\r\nused the domain: www.theovimagazine.com to host material to which he has\r\nno legal right or jurisdiction.\r\n        \r\n        The site carries articles, illustrations, cartoons and other\r\nmaterial that are all copyrighted and he has no permission to use.
