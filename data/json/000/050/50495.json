Because I understand that you are still representing Mr. Moretti. I cannot ethically contact him diredtly. I presume you will inform Mr. Moretti that this is why I am not responding directly to him. Although Mr. Moretti of course has his right too his own opitions, his threat to create websites that are\"currently under construction\" exposes him to additional litigation for two separate reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n First, Mr. Moretti's use of the names \"wernerladder\" and \"lowes\" constitutes an improper tradmark infringement that further appears designed to injure both Werner Company and Lowes. Demand is hereby made that Mr. Moretti immediately ceaase and desist from using either the names\"wernerladder\" or \"lowes\"\r\n\r\n Second, Mr. Moretti must be careful not to make any misrepresentations of fact. Given the context of this matter, any misrepresentation of fact will be construed as an intentional and malicious ac.\r\n\r\n We will continue to carefully monitor this situation and, as always, invite dialogue directly with you to deterimine if we can enter into any agreements that may be mutually satisfactory to all parties.\r\n\r\n Sincerely,\r\n Christian L.
