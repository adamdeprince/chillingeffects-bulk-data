The site is of great concern to ourselves as it is\r\ndamaging our good name and reputation and causing great distress to the Club\r\n\r\nhttp://proddygirl.co.uk\r\n\r\nThe site is registered to Edward Carson but his contact details have been\r\nblocked.  However in any event I doubt that he would answer our emails.  I\r\nhave attached a notice of infringement and would be obliged if you could\r\ndisable this site immediately and provide us with landline addresses etc\r\nwhere we can issue legal papers against the person running this site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am aware that some emails don't accept attachments for security reasons\r\nand if this is the case I can fax this to you if you require.  I would\r\nappreciate if this  could be dealt with as a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nAlistair Campbell\r\nHead of Brand Protection\r\nThe Rangers Football Club plc\r\n\r\nTel :  + 00 44 (0)141 580 8533\r\nFax : + 00 44 (0)141 580 8697\r\nemail : acampbel@rangers.co.uk\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE\r\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\nThe information in this email, and any attachments, is confidential and may\r\nbe legally privileged.
