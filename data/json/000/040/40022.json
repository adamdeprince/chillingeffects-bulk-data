(\"Nintendo\"). We are writing to ask you to stop using the Nintendo\r\nproperties in the hidden text/visible text/meta tags and/or title and/or\r\nlinks of the above-referenced sexually explicit Web site. Nintendo's\r\ncustomers include many children and their parents. Unauthorized use of\r\nNintendo trademark(s)/work(s) is harmful to those customers and will\r\ntarnish Nintendo's reputation.\r\n \r\n\r\nWe look forward to your immediate confirmation that you have taken the\r\nnecessary steps to resolve this matter. To that end, you may email us at\r\nStopInfringement@cyveillance.com.\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease note that these are automatic email boxes so typically no\r\nresponse is sent as long as the problem is corrected.\r\n\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nCyveillance   \r\n","date_sent":"2006-09-13T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-09-13T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Cyveillance (for Nintendo)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
