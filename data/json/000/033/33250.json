I am working with Celeste (Jennifer) to\r\nget \r\nher adult content removed from the internet. We have contacted the\r\nowners of \r\nthe media ( <outbind://41/www.cumfiesta.com> www.cumfiesta.com) and they\r\n\r\nhave graciously removed her content from their pay service web site. We\r\nare \r\nnow following up with all of the various promoters of the cumfiesta.com \r\nwebsite politely asking that they remove their photos of Celeste because\r\nshe \r\nis no longer available for download on the main website. \r\n \r\nWould it be possible for you and your team of admins to remove these\r\nURLs \r\nand move the photo's/movies into a private non public_html folder? (The \r\nmoving of the photo's into a non public_html folder will stop\r\ngoogle/yahoo \r\nimage searches from returning the content after the .html pages are\r\nremoved) \r\n<http://www.teenqueens.net/galleries/celeste.html> \r\nhttp://www.teenqueens.net/galleries/celeste.html \r\n \r\nOr perhaps replace Celeste's pages with another model/woman? \r\n \r\nThe reason we are working on this is due to her personal safety. She has\r\n\r\nbeen attacked twice in 2006 by stalkers and her general safety is of\r\nconcern \r\nto us. People are crazy out there and we no longer want this poor\r\ndecision \r\nwhich she made when she was 20 years old to continue to effect our\r\nfamily \r\nand life. Since the  <outbind://41/www.cumfiesta.com> www.cumfiesta.com\r\nweb \r\nsite is no longer selling her adult content would you please be so kind\r\nas \r\nto remove it from your promoting site? \r\n \r\nWe been working directly with RK Netmedia on this...specifically\r\nMauricio \r\nBotero. If you would like to contact him directly to confirm all of this\r\n\r\nthat is ok too.
