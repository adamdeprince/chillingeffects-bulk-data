I\r\nhave clearly provided evidence that the site is offering illegal cricket\r\nstreams. Below is a screenshot that again illustrates the copyright\r\ninfringment. Again, I also attach a letter of authority from Cricket\r\nAustralia. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of yet we have had no reply to the Cease and Desist notification sent\r\nto the site owner. The notifications sent to both yourself and the site\r\nowner combined with the above screenshot comply with the warning\r\nnotification requirements of the Copyright Act. Accordingly I would\r\nrequest that you remove the site in question to avoid potential legal\r\naction from our clients Cricket Australia. \r\nPlease let me know how you intend to proceed on this matter,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Kiernan \r\n\r\nNetResult\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMike Kiernan\r\n\r\nAccount Executive\r\n\r\nProjector NetResult Ltd\r\nMulberry House,\r\n583 Fulham Road,\r\nLondon,\r\nSW6 5UA \r\n\r\nmikek@nr-online.com <mailto:mikek@nr-online.com> \r\nhttp://www.nr-online.com <http://www.nr-online.com/>  \r\n\r\ntel: \r\n  \r\n\r\n+44 (0)20 7471 1733\r\n \r\n\r\n -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Copyright [mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com\r\n<mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com> ]\r\nSent: 01 December 2006 18:55\r\nTo: mikek@nr-online.com\r\nCc: Theplanet@chillingeffects.org\r\nSubject: FW: [EV1-C1990651Y] FW: Cricket Australia 2006/2007\r\ninfringments - CrkAus_NRID14166\r\n\r\n To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThe URL in question is currently not accessible as of 12:54:22 p.m.\r\n(GMT-6) on December 1, 2006 because it requires proprietary log-in\r\ninformation to access it.\r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\nThe Planet/EV1 Internet\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Abuse@ev1servers.net [mailto:Abuse@ev1servers.net\r\n<mailto:Abuse@ev1servers.net> ] Posted At: Thursday, November 30, 2006\r\n7:20 AM Posted To: DMCA\r\nConversation: [EV1-C1990651Y] FW: Cricket Australia 2006/2007\r\ninfringments - CrkAus_NRID14166\r\nSubject: [EV1-C1990651Y] FW: Cricket Australia 2006/2007 infringments -\r\nCrkAus_NRID14166\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n1.
