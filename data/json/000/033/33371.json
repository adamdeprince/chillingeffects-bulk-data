Do I have to contact the Federal\r\nBureau of Investigation and submit a crime tip (www.fbi.gov), to stop this crime, or\r\nwhat ???\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nNathalie Hoffmann\r\nN","date_sent":"2006-08-11T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-08-11T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Unknown","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
