They do not have a model release, which is against\r\nfederal law and also a requirement for hosting such pictures. We are in\r\nthe process of pursuing legal matters but I wanted to inform you so you\r\nwere not caught in any legal actions we take and also so that these\r\npictures will be taken down as soon as possible. I spoke with one of\r\nyour representatives, Mickey, and he assured me your help on this\r\nmatter. Thank you for your time.\r\n \r\nAlso, my photos are also located on other sites hosted by you,\r\nwww.asphericash.com and www.myplanetgirls.com. These sites are operated\r\nby the same webmaster. I would appreciate their removal also. \r\n \r\nThank you,\r\nElizabeth Adcock\r\n601-720-8139\r\n ","date_sent":"2006-04-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
