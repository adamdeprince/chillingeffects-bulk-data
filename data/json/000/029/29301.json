Specifically, FUNimation is the exclusive\r\nlicensee for production and distribution of home videos, DVDs, video CDs,\r\nand other home video formats and devices (hereafter referred to collectively\r\nas \"Videograms\") within the referenced territories.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur investigations reveal that a site for which your company provides\r\nservices is currently being used to sell and/or distribute unlicensed\r\ndownloads containing episodes, movies, or other embodiments of the\r\nProperties.
