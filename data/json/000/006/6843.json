The odds of this occurring run in the thousands. The original content appears in the Way Back Machine for ThinScalp.com from as far back as 2000 where the Astha Hair Clinic domain wasn\u2019t even registered till April of 2012. The search engines Bing and Yahoo quite clearly show ThinScalp.com as the owner of the mentioned content. Plus neither Bing nor Yahoo list Astha Hair Clinic because of the relative newest of the domain.
