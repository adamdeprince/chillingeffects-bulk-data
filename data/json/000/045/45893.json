Factor has no record even close to the nature of this complaint and\n \nwe believe the reviewer's intention is to damage our reputation and lower \n\nour rating.\n\nP.S.I. Factor follows up with every customer on and after each job to  \nensure the highest quality work standards are met or exceeded. We perform \n\ndetailed written quotes and inspections prior to job-start, to  \nensure \"flooding\" does not occur/and or minimize impact of water based  \ningress.\n\nI can be contacted anytime @ 604-862-3003\n\nThanks!
