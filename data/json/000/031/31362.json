We ask that you immediately\nterminate the hosting of the Identified Blogger Site, in accordance with\nGoogle's terms of service.   \n\n \n\nAs you know, IFPI is a trade association that represents over 1,400 major\nand independent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings (the \"IFPI Represented\nCompanies\"). IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of the IFPI Represented\nCompanies in matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings,\nincluding enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\n\n \n\nIFPI's top priority is to prevent the continued availability of the IFPI\nRepresented Companies' content on the internet.  Unauthorized copies of\nsound recordings that are freely available, especially pre-release\nrecordings, cause substantial damage to the IFPI Represented Companies every\nhour and day they remain available.  In making this communication we are\nseeking to ensure that infringing content is removed from the internet as\nquickly as possible through your cooperation.  However, please note that we\ndo not admit that we or the IFPI Represented Companies are responsible for\ndetecting infringing material and notifying you of it.  Please also note\nthat this communication does not constitute a waiver of any right to recover\ndamages incurred by virtue of the unauthorised activities described in it.\nSuch rights, as well as claims for other relief are hereby expressly\nreserved. \n\n \n\nYou may contact me at IFPI Secretariat, [redacted], London W1J 0DD,\nUnited Kingdom or email  <mailto:[redacted]ifpi.org> [redacted]ifpi.org, to\ndiscuss this communication.  \n\n \n\nWe await your response.\n\n \n\nYours faithfully\n\n \n\n[redacted]\n\nDirector, Internet Anti-Piracy \n\nIFPI\n\n[redacted]\n\nLondon\n\nW1J 0DD\n\nUnited Kingdom \n\nEmail:  <mailto:[redacted]ifpi.org> [redacted]ifpi.org\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<pre>Sheet1\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/il-divo-il-divo.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/03/ana-belen-coleccion-3.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2011/09/michael-jackson-michael.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/mecano-20-grandes-canciones.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/marta-sanchez-3-cds.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2011/02/maria-dolores-pradera-caminemos.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/06/madonna-celebration-3-cds.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/luis-miguel-33.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/05/kylie-minogue-greatest-hits.html\nhttp://www.ludovico-2810.blogspot.com.es/2012/06/julio-iglesias-de-nina-mujer.html\n\fSheet2\n\n\fSheet3\n\n</pre>","date_sent":"2012-07-31T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2012-07-31T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Director, Internet Anti-Piracy","principal_name":"IFPI","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.
