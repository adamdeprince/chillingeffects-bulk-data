I would suggest \r\nyou rip them down ASAP.

Sorry\r\nfor \r\nbeing rude but I dont like to be ignored when someone is stealing my\r\nsoftware \r\nand apps my comapny makes and gives it away for free.\r\n\r\n Your Reseller that allows Warez:\r\nhttp://thevida.com\r\n\r\n The Warez illegal site:\r\nhttp://www.warezdll.net\r\n\r\n Again I want it down asap I will not tolerate this site being online and \r\ngiving away my stuff for free.\r\n\r\n Ron Howard\r\n CEO NetTronicx Inc\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-02-09T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-09T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"NetTronicx Inc","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
