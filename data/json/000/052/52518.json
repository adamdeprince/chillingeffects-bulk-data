Neither Royal Bank or [REDACTED] created this page or authorized anyone to create this page on their behalf. Such use of [REDACTED]'s identity and image is prohibited by law and is also contrary to your rules.\r\n \r\nMoreover, said profile picture posted also includes an RBC Lion & Globe design, which is Royal Bank of Canada's key corporate symbol . Royal Bank is the registered owner of the copyright in the RBC Lion & Globe (registered in April 2007 under registration number VA0001418394) and the owner of at least one registered trademark in the said design (registered in September 2004 under registration number 2885583).  Furthermore, the Twitter account uses the RBC trademark which Royal Bank is the owner of several registered trademarks (such as those registered in June 2001 under registration number 2463205 and October 2005 under registration number 3009050).\r\n \r\nRoyal Bank and/or [REDACTED],  have not authorized this use of [REDACTED]'s photo, his image or the copyrighted or trademark protected work on this Twitter page. The online posting, reproduction and display of this work on your website constitutes clear copyright infringement both in the United States of America and in Canada and Twitter is obligated under section \u00c2\u00a7512(c)(3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove the infringing material immediately following the receipt of this letter. The above information regarding these violations is accurate and I declare, under penalty of perjury, having the authority to act in this matter.\r\n \r\nIn light of the foregoing, I trust that Twitter will take the appropriate steps to respect its obligations under the applicable copyright and trademark legislation and to uphold its rules by (i) immediately remove infringing materials and suspend the account in question, (ii) transferring the user name and password to such account to Royal Bank of Canada and (iii) identifying the user that created such page by providing any information available that is in the possession of Twitter.  \r\n \r\nWe would appreciate if you could promptly confirm the removal of the infringing material and the said deactivation and transfer of the account.  \r\n \r\nAny correspondence regarding this file should be addressed to myself. \r\n \r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n \r\n[redacted]\r\nSenior Counsel,  Intellectual property\r\nRoyal Bank of Canada \r\nT.
