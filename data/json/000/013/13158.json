This specific link has some songs composed by famous composers (and\nsung  \nby famous singers). The meaning is compromised and abused to promote\nnumber  \n1.\n3. Youtube links used.\n4. The report faqs section implies that Blogger do not take down blogs\nthat  \nare acceptable according to US laws. But we are pretty sure that 1 is not \n\naccepted in USA and many other EU countries. So this is not legal (In Sri \n\nLanka it is prohibited and will be prohibited in the future. We do not\ntake  \nUS laws into account because this is promoted in SL and is using Sri\nLankan  \nNative Language).\n5. Please kindly take measures.
