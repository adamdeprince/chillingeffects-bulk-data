I am a 3d modeler and built a lot of\r\ncomputer models and has recently discovered that someone has been stealing\r\nmy creations and modifying them while taking all the credit for work. While\r\nfurther investigation I was advised to contact you as you are suppose to\r\nhosting their website. This is the site address, www.ascendence.net\r\n\r\nI tried to contact the administrator of the site regarding this matter but\r\nreceived a negative reply on this matter which pretty much ignored my\r\nrequest to have my work removed off their server.\r\n\r\nI would like to try and resolve this situation without any further, higher\r\naction taken.\r\n\r\nsincerely\r\n\r\nSerge Drozd\r\n\r\n__________________________________________________\r\nDo You Yahoo!?\r\nTired of spam?
