The site is endorsed by the Zambia Tourism Board but does not belong to them. It is owned entirely by myself and my company Africa Insites (I am the sole proprietor) \r\n\r\nAs I personally traveled the country at my own expense and wrote the text for this entire site myself, I feel this is a serious infringement of copyright.  I have written and asked them to change it, but have been totally ignored.\r\n\r\n  I have now put a right click no copy restriction on my pages to stop it happening again, but this was only when I discovered that the content had been copied. The copyright notice however has always been at the foot of all pages.\r\n\r\nOne of their sites (they both seem to be owned by the same person/company) has other sections, but apart from adverts most of the content on this site has been taken from my site  - word for head, along with many photographs.  Not all the photographs on my site belong to me although many do, but I have permission from various photographers to use their images.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what can be done? \r\n\r\nThanks for your time\r\nAngela","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.zambiatravelguide.com/"},{"url":"http://www.ezambia.com/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.zambiatourism.com"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
