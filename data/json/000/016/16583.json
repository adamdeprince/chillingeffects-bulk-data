I am writing to complain about a blog hosted on \r\n\r\nGoogle/Blogger which posts links to copyrighted audio on a daily basis. The website is \r\n\r\nlocated at http://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/ and the owners profile is here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.blogger.com/profile/24171670.\r\n \r\nThe blog at arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com consists solely of links to audio and video files of \r\n\r\ncopyrighted works being hosted at a variety of file sharing websites - rapidshare.de, \r\n\r\nsendspace.com, rapidshare.corn, and others. arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com \r\nhas repeatedly posted links to music copyrighted by my company without our permission. I \r\n\r\nhave written to the contact given on the blog several time, first to open a dialog, and then \r\n\r\nasking them to cease from posting our work to the web. I have never been given a \r\n\r\nresponse. I have contacted the file sharing websites listed above, each of whom has been \r\n\r\nhelpful in removing these files. However, arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.corn has continued \r\n\r\nuninterrupted and I believe that they are violating Google?s own rules as well as my \r\n\r\ncompany?s rights.\r\n\r\nI have never written to Google with a complaint before. If Google is unwilling to remove this \r\n\r\nblog, I humbly ask that someone contact me clarifying Google?s policy about such blogs.\r\n\r\nThe permalinks listed below contain links to files copyrighted in part or in full by Stones \r\n\r\nThrow Records, LLC.\r\n\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/10/oh-no-exodus-into-unheard-rhythms.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/10/madlib-mind-fusion-vol-5.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/10/madlib-mind-fusion-vol-4.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/10/peanut-butter-wolf-yo-45-raps.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/05/madlib-presents-dudley-perkins.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/06/stones-throw-ten-years.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/06/j-dilla-tribute-album-bonus-disc-disc.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/06/kashmere-stage-band-aint-no-sunshine.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/06/roc-c-all-questions-answered.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/07/oh-no-exodus-into-unheard-rhythmsclean_0\r\n\r\n9.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/09/peanut-butter-wolf-presents-chrome.html\r\nhttp://arnie-bossplayer.blogspot.com/2006/09/aloe-blacc-shine-through-cdlp-2006.html\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material described above on the \r\n\r\nallegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. \r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that \r\n\r\nI am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive \r\n\r\nright that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nThank You","date_sent":"2006-10-25T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-10-25T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Stones Throw Records","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
