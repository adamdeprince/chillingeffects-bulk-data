The  \nowner of the blog has also included photographs of myself and my Husband  \nthat have been taken from Facebook without our consent (the owner of the  \nblog has no access to our accounts but seems to have used screen captures \n\nand resized the images rendering them blurry). The content of the blog is \n\nslanderous in that it violates my right to privacy and also presents a  \ndistorted and untrue account of myself and my family - my name is\nChristine  \nMoloney and i have never masqueraded as anyone else, nor am i married to  \nanyone but my Husband. I am mentioned by name in every blog post and my  \nHusband also. I am not 'hired out' or playing a double game. I am a  \nlecturer by profession and if a prospective employer stumbles across this,\n \nor a student, it could cause huge problems. The owner of this blog has\nbeen  \ntaken to court numerous times for libellous blogs and websites. If this is\n \nnot taken down i will have to ask the courts for redress.\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://della-farrant.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/della-farrant-delivers-della-rant.html"},{"url":"http://della-farrant.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/della-farrants-identity-revealed.html"},{"url":"http://della-farrant.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/della-farrants-true-identity_08.html"},{"url":"http://della-farrant.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/solemnisation-of-dellas-marriage.html"},{"url":"http://della-farrant.blogspot.co.uk/search?updated-min=2012-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&updated-max=2013-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&max-results=8"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
