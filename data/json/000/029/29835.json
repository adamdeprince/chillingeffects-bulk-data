They have also violated a Non-Disclosure\r\nstatement on taking our Day Trading course and have out and out\r\nslandered us on their site, namely: \r\n \r\ndougwestexposed.com \r\n \r\nIt is our understanding that you provide the ISP for the name servers on\r\nthis domain. One glance at the above site and you can see that it is a\r\npurely hateful and vengeful site. \r\n \r\nThe main image he has pirated can be seen on our site at: \r\n \r\nhttp://oiopro.com/images/WestDoug_150w.jpg\r\n(he may now have taken this image down) \r\n \r\nSee our terms of use page at: \r\n \r\nhttp://oiopro.com/tou.html \r\n \r\nYou can view our Affiliate & Student Agrement at: \r\n \r\nhttp://oiopro.com/RepAgreement.html \r\n \r\nWe ask that you pull the plug on this site ASAP.
