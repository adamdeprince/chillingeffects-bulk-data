The\r\npurloined \r\ninformation is then sent to an email account and, based on our \r\ninvestigation of similar schemes, used to steal accounts and commit \r\nother fraudulent acts including international credit card and wire \r\nfraud. \r\n\r\nThis matter is urgent - we believe that consumers have been falsely \r\ndirected to this page and may be fooled into divulging personal \r\ninformation to a criminal if the page is not immediately disabled.
