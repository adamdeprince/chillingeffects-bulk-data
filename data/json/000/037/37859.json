There is an outfit that you host at\r\nhttp://hghspray.pillslist.info who has pirated all of my site materials, and\r\nuntil yesterday, he was even posting my picture along with a phony name, one\r\nDr. Andrew Johnson. He knows that I am on to him, and as of this morning, he\r\ntook off my picture and replaced it with a graph. But I kept copies. He is\r\nstill using all of my other materials.\r\nClick on his link entitled \"Report\" and scroll down to the bottom of it.\r\nThe phone number you will see listed, 512 295 4256, is my phone number,\r\nwhich he attributes to a \"Dr. Johnson\". He just did a \"find and replace\"\r\nto substitute that name for my name, but he foolishly left my phone number.\r\n\r\nI have talked to the FBI and they have opened an investigation of him and\r\ngiven it a case number: 105120112048323. I believe his name is Paul King,\r\nand I believe he has an associate, one Octav M. I don't know his last name.\r\nThey are based out of Montreal, Canada, it seems, and they have a\r\nfulfillment center in Grawn, Michigan. I am asking you to shut down that\r\nsite, and by the way, they have other sites under pillsexpert.com which may\r\nbe bogus too.\r\n\r\nMy name is Dr. Ralph Cinque. My phone is 512 295 4256. My email is\r\ndoctorcinque@hotmail.com <mailto:doctorcinque@hotmail.com>. My web address\r\n(from which they stole the materials) is www.hgh2live.com\r\n<http://www.hgh2live.com>. Please put a stop to this right away. I know that\r\nyour company is not the least bit in the wrong, and in a way, you are\r\nvictims too. I would appreciate your immediate assistance.
