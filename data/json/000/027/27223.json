We have just discovered that this site has \r\ncompletely stolen our content and, after replacing any occurrences of\r\nour \r\nbusiness name with their own name, they are now displaying our content\r\nas \r\ntheir own! \r\n \r\nI rang your support line who advised me to report this to the \r\nabuse@theplanet.com address. Since then I have seen information on your\r\nsite \r\nthat suggests I should report it to your legal team at \r\ncopyright@theplanet.com, so I am sending this email to both addresses. \r\n \r\nApart from the fact that the material taken is entirely our copyright,\r\nwe \r\nare very concerned that the duplicate content might be adversely\r\naffecting \r\nour ranking in the Search Engines! We would like to request that you\r\nremove \r\nthis material from your servers with all possible haste. \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------- \r\n(I believe the following statements are required before you can proceed\r\nwith \r\nany action) \r\n \r\nStatements:  \r\n \r\nI verify that I, Glynis Edwards owner of Travel-Quest, am the owner of\r\nthe \r\ncopyrighted material which is the material found on the website \r\nhttp://www.travel-quest.co.uk. \r\n \r\nI, as the complaining party, have a good faith belief that the use of\r\nthe \r\nmaterial in the manner complained of is not authorized by me, the\r\ncopyright \r\nowner, its agent, or the law. \r\n \r\nI verify that the information in the notification is accurate, and under\r\n\r\npenalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on \r\nbehalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. \r\nGlynis Edwards \r\nOwner, travel-quest.co.uk \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------- \r\n \r\nDetails of our complaint: \r\n \r\nWe own the URL:  \r\nhttp://www.travel-quest.co.uk and have run our travel directory on this\r\nURL \r\nsince November 1998 \r\n \r\nOur WhoIs info:  \r\nhttp://webwhois.nic.uk/cgi-bin/whois.cgi?query=travel-quest.co.uk&WHOIS+\r\nSubm \r\nit.x=6&WHOIS+Submit.y=12 \r\n \r\nOur office address is: \r\ntravel-quest.co.uk, Quest Directories, 40 Magdalen Avenue, Bath, BA2\r\n4QB, \r\nUnited Kingdom \r\nPhone: 01225 481 470  Fax: 01225 420 869 \r\nAs can be seen on our site contact page and as is also shown on the\r\nAlexa \r\nrecord: \r\nhttp://www.alexa.com/data/details/contact_info?url=www.travel-quest.co.u\r\nk \r\n(uktravelnet.com have deleted the postal address from their version of\r\nthe \r\ncontact page and you will note that none of their email forms work!) \r\n \r\nThe information on Internet Archive Wayback Machine should also help\r\nverify \r\nownership: \r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/*/www.travel-quest.co.uk \r\n \r\nIf you wish to see a handwritten signature I will gladly fax this to\r\nyou, on \r\nour letter headed paper. If you also wish to see a signature from Mr\r\nPaul \r\nRiddy (Quest Designs, 79 Clarendon Road, Shirley, Southampton, Hants,\r\nSO16 \r\n4GD, UK), who is the person named on our WhoIs information (but who is a\r\n\r\nsleeping partner in the business now), I can also arrange that. Please\r\nlet \r\nme know if either or both of this is required and what fax number to\r\nsend it \r\nto. \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------- \r\nFor further verification of our ownership of the material: \r\n \r\nOn the offending site, please go to the home page and try a search in\r\nthe \r\nsearch box at the top right of the page, in the results you will see\r\nthat \r\nthe top banner is showing our top banner and that the results listed\r\nlink to \r\ntravel-quest.co.uk -- not uktravelnet.com. The search is provided by an \r\nexternal service and uktravelnet.com cannot control the results. \r\n \r\nOn the offending site, please see http://www.uktravelnet.com/promo1.htm\r\nand \r\nlook at the link in the text to 'Shoreline Hotel', this is an affiliate\r\nlink \r\nand you will see we are directly identified in this link \r\n(http://butlins.at/travelquest@DURL=http_3A_ ...) \r\nAlso see http://www.uktravelnet.com/tqhome.htm and look at the Amazon\r\nbutton \r\nin the left-hand margin, this is also an affiliate link and again we are\r\n\r\ndirectly identified as the affiliate -- there are many, many similar \r\nexamples throughout the site and, if necessary, I can get the Affiliate \r\nNetworks concerned to confirm to you that the less easy to identify \r\naffiliate links are also using our unique id's. \r\n \r\nOn the offending site, go to \r\nhttp://www.uktravelnet.com/editorial/cyclekids.htm and read the image\r\nalt \r\ntags on the top banner, which read \"return to travel-quest specialist \r\ntravel\" etc. \r\n \r\nThere are also a fair number of pages that uktravelnet.com failed to\r\nsteal, \r\nso internal links to these do not work, see \r\nhttp://www.uktravelnet.com/tqyoga.htm and try the link to Karuna Yoga\r\nSchool \r\nat the foot of the page, or the link to an article about Karuna Yoga\r\nSchool \r\nin the left hand side column. Again I can find you plenty more examples\r\nif \r\nrequired. \r\n \r\nWe are listed in the ODP at: \r\nhttp://dmoz.org/Recreation/Travel/Guides_and_Directories/ \r\nWe are listed on Yahoo at: \r\nhttp://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/United_Kingdom/Business_and_Econ\r\nomy/ \r\nShopping_and_Services/Travel_and_Transportation/Directories/ \r\nA newspaper article from The Guardian (a very well respected, top UK \r\nnewspaper), dated March 6 2004: \r\nhttp://travel.guardian.co.uk/article/2004/mar/06/travelwebsites.internet\r\n.gua \r\nrdiansaturdaytravelsection links to our site. \r\n \r\nInternet Archive Wayback Machine: \r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/*/www.uktravelnet.com clearly shows that \r\nuktravelnet.com was not using our information prior to (at least) Feb\r\n2006, \r\ncompare that to Wayback information for our site: \r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/*/www.travel-quest.co.uk \r\n \r\nPlease let me know if you need further verification. \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------- \r\nWhat we have discovered about uktravelnet.com: \r\n \r\nWhoIs info: \r\nhttp://reports.internic.net/cgi/whois?whois_nic=uktravelnet.com&type=dom\r\nain \r\nAnd this one, which is showing an address in China (but it doesn't\r\nalways \r\ndisplay full details): \r\nhttp://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=www.uktravelnet.com \r\n>> Registrant: GoFly Media, 46-3-501 TianShuiYuan DongLi, beijing, NA\r\n100026, CN \r\n>> Domain name: UKTRAVELNET.COM \r\n>>  \r\n>> Administrative Contact: xiaofei, song  fifthseason78@yahoo.ca \r\n>> 46-3-501 TianShuiYuan DongLi, beijing, NA 100026, CN \r\n>> +1.4047450137  Fax: +1.4047450137 \r\n>>  \r\n>> Technical Contact: (same as admin contact) \r\n>>  \r\n>> Registrar of Record: REGISTERFLY.COM, INC. \r\n>> Record expires on 05-Jan-2008. \r\n>> Record created on 05-Jan-2005. \r\n>>  \r\n>> Domain servers in listed order: \r\n>> NS2.ICH-6.COM   69.93.99.67 \r\n>> NS1.ICH-6.COM   69.93.99.66 \r\n>>  \r\n>> Domain status: clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited \r\n>  \r\nOn Alexa the following information is given about the ownership of \r\nuktravelnet.com: \r\nhttp://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&url=www.uktravelnet.com \r\n>> Contact Info for uktravelnet.com: \r\n>> Racing-Live Network, 5 Great Marlborough St, London W1V 2AR, UNITED\r\nKINGDOM \r\n>> 2255 390 5541, Fax: 225539062  info [at] racing-live.co.uk \r\nAlthough I suspect that this information is out-of-date, or details of a\r\n\r\nprevious owner, because the phone and fax numbers are \"unobtainable\"\r\nwhen \r\ndialled. \r\n \r\nI can confirm that the site was stolen some time around the 19th\r\nDecember \r\n2006 (we can tell this by noting which companies are listed as 'recent \r\nadditions', but also take a look at the offers on the news page which\r\nare \r\nshowing Christmas deals and out-of-date offers!) \r\n \r\n---------------------------------------------- \r\n \r\nI sincerely hope you can help in this as it is damaging our business.\r\nPlease \r\nlet me know if your require any additional information form us.
