According to DMCA laws, you need to remove her copyrighted materials immediately, as she has complied with your reporting process and has provided the information that you need. Please act at once to shut this group down, as more of her copyrighted materials are being posted here daily. Her company is losing money every day that her copyrighted patterns are continuing remain as downloadable files on your Google hosted site. Ms. Green has reported this weeks ago, and we would like to know why the copyright infringements are allowed to continue on this group. Her copyrighted materials listed below are still posted and available for download on this group. I request that you immediately shut down this group due to its blatant disregard of Federal and International Copyright Laws as well as Google's own terms of service. The group owner Peggy James' previous Google group (DmommaJSharesPC) was shut down for the same reason of blatant copyright violations. How much longer will she be permitted to use Google services illegally?\r\n\r\nPreviously DMCA Complaint Below:\r\n\r\nThis is to inform you that many of my copyrighted craft booklets appear in their entirety as scanned images posted on your hosted online group \"Dmommas PC Mess\" at:http://groups.google.com/group/Dmommas-PC-Mess\r\nThese illegal copies of my patterns have all been posted by the Group Owner and sole poster to this group, Peggy James, email address, dmommajsharespc@gmail.com\r\n\r\nI am the exclusive owner of the copyrights to these following craft booklets and have not granted permission for anyone to post these publicly.
