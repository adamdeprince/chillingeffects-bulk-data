His site is named Babefight.com and, after seeing what is\r\ncontained in his members area, I can tell you that it almost completely\r\nmaterial from other similar websites.  Some of it is free samples taken from\r\nother websites, much of it is illegally reposted material from the members\r\nareas of other websites.  I do not believe that he produces any content\r\nhimself merely takes from others and then charges for it.  This is despite\r\nthe claim on the front of the website that all material is exclusive to him.\r\nMost of the material has had the original owners' web address cropped off of\r\nthe pictures and their video clips have been altered with new title cards.\r\n\r\nI can name many websites that the material has been taken from if you need\r\nto confirm copyright infringement.  I am in contact with one webmaster now\r\nwho will gladly write and confirm that his material has been illegally\r\nreposted and I'm sure that many others would like to know the situation and\r\nget this site closed down.\r\n\r\nI have an active subscription to the site now and would be glad to provide\r\nyou with any further information or explicit examples that you might need.\r\nI have complained to his card processors as well about his practices.\r\n\r\nAs I believe that you host his site I hope that there's something that can\r\nbe done about these flagrant violations of copyright.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nScott van Sickle\r\nvanskl@aol.com <mailto:vanskl@aol.com>\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFEDKrTvK/XpJs6oyURAjYmAKCMFkJFhbIC5mUz8dc9ZSxTT3/jBACfbVmQ\r\n8gG28Sb0PpemdyIEny6Ok0s=\r\n=i523\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-06-06T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-06-06T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Scott van Sickle","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
