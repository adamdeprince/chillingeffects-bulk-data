{"dmca":{"id":7891,"type":"Dmca","title":"Subpoena Report","body":"My internet service provider is Timewarner Cable. I have been trying to reach someone in security for two days. I received a call in July from a Settlement Information Line. They told me I was being named in a lawsuit for music downloads, and was asked I if I wanted to talk about settlement. I said no. I thought it was some kind of scam. I immediately called Timewarner Cable because this person said they got my personal information from Timewarner. Timewarner told me they knew of no such lawsuit and they did not give them my info. On Monday August 29th 2005, a man driving a wrecker tow truck drives up my driveway. I thought he was going to ask for directions instead he hands me this civil summons. I have never downloaded music or copied music. However my computer and IP address have been compromised. Someone go into my computer and was using it to send bulk spam and bulk e-mails. I spent months on the phone with Timewarner trying to resolve these issues. I had some kind of wicked virus that they finally had to suspend my service and I had to have my whole computer reformatted before I could get back on line. I feel sure this is where all this is coming from but I cannot get them to listen to me and I cannot get Timewarner to talk to me Please help I have done nothing wrong.Thank you for your time. I am at my wits end.","date_sent":"2005-08-19T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-08-19T04:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Brooks,Pierce,McClendon,Humphrey,and Leonard,LLP","principal_name":"sonybmg,aristarecords,virginrecords,umg,bmg,elektraentertainment","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
