Theodore Lee (http://www.theodorelee.com) has infringed on\r\nmany of my online materials including my website design, HTML code,\r\nstylesheet code, and duplicated images.\r\n \r\nThis infringement happened earlier this week (August 9) and I contacted this\r\nperson without response as he continues to use my hard work as his own.\r\n \r\nI have attached an official DMCA notice which outlines specifically what is\r\nbeing used illegally, and I hope to have the infringing files disabled as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n \r\nThank-you so much for your understanding.\r\n \r\n-- james\r\n \r\n..................................\r\nJames White\r\nSignalnoise.com\r\nwww.signalnoise.com\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-08-12T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-08-12T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Signalnoise.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
