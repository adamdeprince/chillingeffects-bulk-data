(\"BPI\").\r\n\r\n     It is well known that Google is a service provider directory that links users to an online location.  Pursuant to its Terms of Service, Google also prohibits the  use of its service to link to web sites which contain infringing material.  I refer you  to 17 U.S.C.   512(d) of the DMCA which provides that an internet service provider is protected from liability,\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=notice>\r\n                     \"by reason of the provider referring or linking users to an online location containing infringing material or infringing activity, by using information location tools, including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hypertext link, if the service provider . . .\r\n\r\n                   (3) upon notification of claimed infringement . . . responds\r\n expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity, except for purposes of this paragraph . . .  the information [for notification] shall be identification of the reference or link, to material or activity claimed to be infringing, that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate that reference or link.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n17 U.S.C.   512(d).  See also, Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Reimerdes, 111 \r\nF.Supp.2d 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2000), where the court held that posting hyperlinks  to other web sites that were in violation of the DMCA, itself violated the  DMCA.\r\n\r\n     Currently, Google is providing a link to a web page which contains  literally hundreds of our clients' copyrighted works.  This web site is \"www.clambake.org\"  I have attached a Chart for you setting forth each of the infringements that are contained on the \"www.clambake.org\" web site and proof of our clients' ownership of the works in question.  \r\n\r\n     This particular web site owner has placed our clients' copyrighted works on his web page without the authorization of our clients.  Accordingly, his actions are in violation of United States copyright law and I request Google either remove or disable access to the  web site, \"www.clambake.org\".\r\n\r\n          The Search Query used is: Scientology\r\n          Infringing Web Page: www.clambake.org\r\n\r\n     I have a good faith belief, and in fact know for certain, that the posting of these works was not authorized by my clients, any agent of my clients, or the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I declare under penalty of perjury that this information is accurate and  that I am authorized to act on behalf of RTC and BPI in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[private]\r\nMoxon & Kobrin\r\n[address]\r\nLos Angeles, California 90010\r\nTel: [private]\r\nFax: [private]","date_sent":"2002-04-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-04-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Moxon & Kobrin","principal_name":"Religious Technology Center and Bridge Publications","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
