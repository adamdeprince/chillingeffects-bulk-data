This is going to start a chainball effect\r\nthat is going to get very ugly. I never gave anyone permission to sell\r\nmy products in this manner. The website I'm talking about is hosted on\r\nhostgator.com servers and is located at: \r\n \r\nhttp://www.private-label-rights-software-and-ebooks.com \r\n \r\nThere's a hot thread about this issue going on in the most popular\r\nInternet Marketing forum right now. You can read about it at: \r\n \r\nhttp://www.warriorforum.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=130118&whichpage=1 \r\n \r\nPlease do something about this right away. The titles of the ebooks that\r\nbelong to me are: \r\n \r\n - AdSense Revenue Exposed\r\n - Ghostwriters From The Inside Out\r\n - Offline Marketing Strategies For Online Businesses\r\n - Bloggers Guide To Profits\r\n - Mining Gold From Ebay\r\n - Offline Marketing Strategies For Online Businesses\r\n - PC Safety 101\r\n - Podcasting Made Easy\r\n - The Newbie's Guide To Making Software\r\n - Starting a Paid Membership Website \r\n \r\nI look forward to hearing back from you. \r\n \r\nThank you, \r\n \r\nMichael Rasmussen \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nQuoting Hostgator Abuse <abuse@hostgator.com>: \r\n \r\n> Hello,\r\n> I didn't disable /home/mpras/public_html/horses-edu/links/admin \r\n> someone else must have because of the resource usage.
