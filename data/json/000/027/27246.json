Unauthorized duplication of copyrighted software =\r\nproducts constitutes copyright infringement for which the Federal =\r\nCopyright Act, specifically 17 U.S.C. =A7 504(c), allows the recovery of\r\n=\r\nstatutory damages of up to $150,000 per product for willful conduct.  =\r\nEven if willful conduct cannot be conclusively established, Section 504\r\n=\r\npermits the copyright owner to elect an award of non-willful statutory =\r\ndamages of as much as $30,000 for each work infringed without the =\r\nnecessity of demonstrating actual damages.  Additionally, 17 U.S.C. =A7\r\n=\r\n505 permits the court to award to the prevailing party its costs and =\r\nreasonable attorneys' fees.   =20\r\n\r\nSony's rights in the Sony Works are of enormous value.  Sony takes =\r\nreports of copyright and trademark infringement very seriously and will\r\n=\r\nnot hesitate to pursue all available legal remedies.  Your potential =\r\nexposure in this matter, should it be litigated, is significant.  =\r\nDespite the potential for a large monetary judgment, we believe that it\r\n=\r\nis in the best interest of all parties to resolve this matter amicably.\r\n=\r\nHowever, if you do not immediately cease and desist from the conduct =\r\npreviously described in this letter, Sony reserves the right to =\r\ninstitute appropriate proceedings against you without delay and with no\r\n=\r\nfurther notice.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this letter is to formally demand that you:=20\r\n\r\n(1)        Immediately cease and desist from using, copying and =\r\ndisplaying the Sony Works;=20\r\n\r\n(2)        Immediately cease and desist from creating derivative works =\r\nfrom the Sony Works;\r\n\r\n(3)        Immediately cease and desist from distributing any and all =\r\ncopies of the Sony Works that you have already copied;\r\n\r\n(4)        Immediately cease and desist from violating the federal =\r\ncopyright laws, 17 U.S.C. =A7 101 et seq., as well as other common law =\r\nand statutory laws in any manner not specifically set forth in this =\r\nletter; and\r\n\r\n(5)        Immediately cease and desist from utilizing any unauthorized\r\n=\r\nuse of Sony's trademarks and violating the federal and state unfair =\r\ncompetition laws, including the Lanham Act, as well as other common law\r\n=\r\nand statutory laws in any manner not specifically set forth in this =\r\nletter. =20\r\n\r\nIf you fail to comply with each of the conditions set forth in this =\r\nletter, Sony reserves the right to take all appropriate action, =\r\nincluding but not limited to filing a lawsuit seeking an immediate =\r\ninjunction against you and ultimately the award of damages and =\r\nattorneys' fees.\r\n\r\nThis office is sending this correspondence on behalf of Sony, herein =\r\nreferred to as Client.
