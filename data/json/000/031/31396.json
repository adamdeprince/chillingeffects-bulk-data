A website that you host,\r\nhttp://maxxuss.batcave.net, is currently distributing software that allows\r\nfor the unauthorized installation of Apple's Mac OS X operating system on a\r\ngeneric x86 computer.  This software contains decrypted versions of\r\nencryption-protected files that Apple distributes with Mac OS X version\r\n10.4.  These files are copyrighted and contain Apple's trade secrets.  Apple\r\nprotects these files with encryption keys specific to a single end-user\r\npurchaser.  Any unauthorized use or distribution of these files is strictly\r\nprohibited, and violates your acceptable use policy\r\n(http://theplanet.com/legal/index.html).  \r\n\r\nApple demands that you take steps to immediately disable\r\nhttp://maxxuss.batcave.net and any applicable mirror sites.  Failure to do\r\nso may subject you to criminal and civil liability.  Please notify me by\r\nreply e-mail as soon as the site has been disabled.  \r\n\r\nApple is prepared to take further action with regards to this matter, and\r\nexpressly reserves its rights to do so.
