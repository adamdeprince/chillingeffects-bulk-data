Symantec also holds the registered trademark in the U.S.\r\nand other countries for its name, SYMANTEC(r).  Symantec's rights are\r\nevidenced by, among other things, registrations of its trademarks and\r\ncopyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the\r\nUnited States Copyright Office.  Symantec also includes product\r\nactivation technology in its products to prevent access by unauthorized\r\nparties to its copyrighted products, including without limitation,\r\nproduct subscription updates, renewals and activations.\r\n\r\nSymantec has been notified that you provide Internet access for the IP\r\naddress listed below.  We have determined that this site is posting\r\nunauthorized Symantec product crack codes and/or keygen or other\r\ninstructions for public distribution that enable unauthorized parties to\r\nillegally activate or extend Symantec's copyrighted product\r\nsubscriptions and/or product key activations on a server registered to\r\nthe party listed below.  The URL for the crack instructions is listed\r\nherein.  A screenshot of these instructions taken from the site is\r\nattached, together with the homepage of the posting website.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch distribution is not authorized by Symantec, its agents or the law,\r\nand thus constitutes infringement, among other things.  \r\n\r\nAs you know, unauthorized use of Symantec's trademarks, and unauthorized\r\ncopying and/or distribution of Symantec's copyrighted works, is a\r\nviolation of federal and state laws.  It is illegal to produce, sell or\r\ndistribute such unauthorized works.  Distribution of devices that can be\r\nused to disable protective technologies that prevent unauthorized use of\r\nSymantec's copyrighted products is also a violation of federal law.  In\r\nparticular, Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\r\nproscribes devices or services that are primarily designed or produced\r\nto circumvent technological measures that prevent unauthorized access to\r\na copyrighted work.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, the deliberate and clear infringement of Symantec's\r\nprotected copyright and trademark rights, and the harm to Symantec's\r\nbusiness and goodwill from the infringing use, Symantec demands that you\r\nimmediately investigate and take action to stop this infringing\r\nactivity, and inform us of the results of your actions.
