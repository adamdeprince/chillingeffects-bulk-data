We have included a copy of the complaint letter.  Pursuant to the \r\nprovisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), which is codified \r\nat 17 U.S.C. &#65533; 512, upon receiving such notification, Cox is required to \"act \r\nexpeditiously to remove, or disable access to\" the infringing material in order \r\nto avoid liability for any alleged copyright infringement.  Accordingly, Cox \r\nwill suspend your account and disable your connection to the Internet within 24 \r\nhours of your receipt of this email if the offending material is not removed. \r\n \r\n \r\nIt is not permitted to share copyrighted material with anyone even if you \r\npurchased the media from an authorized site without expressed written permission \r\nfrom the copyright holder. \r\n \r\n \r\nPlease be aware that the DMCA also provides procedures by which a subscriber \r\naccused of copyright violation can respond to the allegations of infringement \r\nand, under certain circumstances, cause his or her account to be reinstated.  To \r\ndo so, however, the response must meet certain criteria.  Pursuant to section \r\n(g) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. &#65533; 512(g)), you have the right to submit to Cox a \r\ncounter-notification which, to be effective, must include the following \r\nelements:  \r\n \r\n \r\n(a)\ta physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; \r\n(b)\tidentification of the material that has been removed or to which access has \r\nbeen disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was \r\nremoved or disabled; \r\n(c)\ta statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith \r\nbelief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or \r\nmisidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; \r\n(d)\tthe subscriber&#65533;s name, address, and telephone number and a statement that \r\nthe subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for \r\nthe judicial district in which the address is located. \r\n \r\n \r\nIn the event that you submit to Cox a counter-notification that includes these \r\nelements, Cox will forward your counter notification to the complainant and \r\nadvise them that Cox will cease disabling access to the allegedly infringing \r\nmaterial in ten (10) business days.  Unless the complainant notifies us that it \r\nhas filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in the \r\nallegedly infringing activity prior to the expiration of those ten (10) business \r\ndays, Cox will reactivate your account. \r\n \r\n \r\nPlease refer to this help article for more information: \r\nhttp://support.cox.com/sdccommon/asp/contentredirect.asp?sprt_cid=c2a30ae8-d706-\r\n4f6e-beb9-618ea54d1791 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\n \r\nCox Customer Security \r\n\t \r\n\t--- Original Message --- \r\n \r\n??????????/?????????&#65533;?????ISP: Cox Communications, Inc.  \r\nIP Address: 68.231.133.63 \r\n \r\nFriday, June 13, 2008 \r\n \r\nRe: Unauthorized Copying and Distribution of Copyrighted Audiovisual Works \r\n \r\nDear Sir/Madam: \r\n \r\nI am contacting you on behalf of the Motion Picture Association of America \r\n(&#65533;MPAA&#65533;) and one or more of its member companies. \r\n \r\nWe submit that the MPAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies \r\n(the &#65533;MPAA Members&#65533;) with respect to the matter described in this notice.
