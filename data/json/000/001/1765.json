{"dmca":{"id":1765,"type":"Dmca","title":"No more \"Nut-Meg\"","body":"          To owner of the Yahoo \"nut_meg\" group. \r\n\r\n          It has come to my attention that the \"nut_meg\" group contains defamatory material concerning [Private], a member of staff of AIAS, of which I am Director and Board Chairman. Accordingly you are advised of legal precedent in Britain (attached) and I demand that the nut_meg group be shut down.     \r\n\r\n         The \"[redacted]\" group was shut down last night, a de facto admission of libel.\r\n\r\n         In British law you are acting ILLEGALLY, a website that contains defamatory information must be removed by the ISP if it is alleged that that website contains defamatory information. I am alleging that now as Director of AIAS. I reside in Britain and I am a US/British dual citizen. Lt.Col. [Private] is a member of staff of AIAS and so British law applies. In US law the First Amendement does not protect libel. Your website contains libel de facto, for example it is untruthfully claimed that Col. Bearden is bankrupt. This demonstrably and factually untrue. \r\n            I will copy this message to Yahoo, the ISP, with another strong formal complaint against you. \r\n\r\nSincerelyt,\r\n[Private], D. Sc. (Wales),\r\nAIAS Director,      \r\n","date_sent":"2003-07-01T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-07-01T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","International"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"organizer of Yahoo group","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
