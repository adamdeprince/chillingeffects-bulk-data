{"dmca":{"id":13208,"type":"Dmca","title":"Cartoonist not amused by Google Groups posting","body":"Sat, 22 Jul 2006 12:12:58 -0000\r\n\r\nThank you for deleting the messages containing attachments of Julius'\r\ncopyrighted materials. Unfortunately, that has not stopped this Group owner.\r\nHe has posted more copyrighted drawings. [I have also found some postings\r\nthat I missed in the previous complaint which I include here as well.]\r\n\r\nAnd although the messages have been removed from his site, you must\r\nunderstand that all of the members of this Google Group who elected to\r\nreceive individual emails rather than check the postings on the website,\r\nreceived all of these drawings in their email boxes when the postings were\r\nfirst distributed to the members' email addresses. And as long as this\r\nGoogle Group owner continues to post copyrighted drawings, the illegality of\r\nhis actions is only mitigated by the removal of the messages. Consequently,\r\nJulius and I request that you take more postitive action with this Group,\r\nsmilar to the action that the Yahoo Copyright Agent takes in cases of repeat\r\nviolations (i.e., close the Group).\r\n\r\nHere are the details of the current postings:\r\n\r\n1. The copyrighted work is pages from the following books, illustrated by\r\nJulius who is my business parter at Juliart Productions, and who is the\r\nlegal copyright owner: Devils Canyon, Part I, \"Glominus Files\",\r\nand \"Erection Crew\".\r\n\r\n2. All of the copyrighted material relating to the above books appear in the\r\nGoogle Group Art-Cartoon-smoking-men and all of the URLs for each of the\r\npostings containing copyrighted drawings can be found by performing the a\r\nsearch of that Google Groups posting using the following\r\nsearch: http://groups.google.com/group/Art-Cartoon-smoking-men/search?\r\ngroup=Art-Cartoon-smoking-men&q=J+-+&qt_g=1&searchnow=Search+this+group\r\nThere are 11 postings from a Google Group member who calls himself\r\nToon Hound.\r\n\r\nPer your instructions in an email to me, here is the Message ID information\r\nfor all of these pages:\r\n\r\nErection Crew\r\nMessage-Id: < 20060629114546.4FB0ADA824@mailserver7.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 20060701121724.47400DA820@mailserver8.hushmail.com>\r\n\r\nDevils Canyon, Part I\r\nMessage-Id: < 20060623145014.3E4A9DA826@mailserver8.hushmail.com>\r\n\r\nGreek Story\r\nMessage-Id: < 20060525132322.4152FDA821@mailserver8.hushmail.com>\r\n\r\nGlominus Files\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211140.k6LBe2Zr005154@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211137.k6LBbwbX005072@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211137.k6LBbJTT005049@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211140.k6LBem1K005193@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211139.k6LBdOAb005121@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211138.k6LBcc5x005102@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\nMessage-Id: < 200607211133.k6LBX8Ch004944@mailserver3.hushmail.com>\r\n\r\n3.
