We expect that you will take\r\nexpeditious action to remove or disable access to the materials\r\ndescribed above, and thereby prevent the illegal reproduction and\r\ndistribution of pirated software via your company's network. As you\r\nknow, illegal on-line activities can result in 50 million people on the\r\nInternet accessing and downloading a copyrighted product worldwide\r\nwithout authorization - a highly damaging activity for the copyright\r\nholder.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
