Your\r\ndistribution of unauthorized images, as well as your use of Ms. Milano's\r\nname in metatags on your web site, violate Ms. Milano's rights of publicity,\r\nprivacy, and trademark, and defames his/her reputation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWithout limitation, your conduct violates California Civil Code ' 3344 and\r\n15 U.S.C.' 1125(a).  Further, your reproduction and distribution of the\r\nimages violate various copyrights held and/or licensed by Ms. Milano.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMoreover, because some of the images on this web site appear to have been\r\nillegally copied from copyrighted films and/or photographs, your web site\r\nmay also infringe upon the rights of various copyright owners.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMs. Milano greatly values the interest and loyalty of his/her fans, and has\r\ncreated an official web site to allow a safe and appropriate place for\r\nhis/her fans to find him/her on the Internet.  Your distribution of\r\ninfringing images not only violates Ms. Milano's rights, but also hurts\r\nhis/her fans who unwillingly find themselves on your site rather than\r\nhis/her official site.  Your infringing actions are especially damaging\r\nbecause of the sexually explicit content which appears on your web site.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe hereby demand that you and all those who have acted in concert with you\r\nimmediately cease any copying, transmission, or other use of Ms. Milano's\r\nname and image, and that you delete from your site or other sites operated\r\nor owned by you all unauthorized depictions of Alyssa Milano.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe expect that you will accede to our requests.  However, if we do not\r\nreceive your written confirmation before the close of business on 2/16/2005,\r\nthat you have complied with these requests, we will have no option but to\r\nturn this matter over to litigation counsel.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLin Milano\r\n\r\nCEO, Safesearching\r\n\r\n3575 Chauegna Blvd.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, CA  90068","date_sent":"2005-02-15T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-15T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Safesearching","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
