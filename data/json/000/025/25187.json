Almedia (Designated Agent) or To whom it may concern,\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have a customer who has a website called http://www.bikinibikini.com\r\nand\r\nthey have a message board where their members constantly posts\r\ncopyrighted\r\nimages that we own that they hacked from our websites which are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eyecandymodeling.com\r\nhttp://www.eyecandyxtreme.com\r\nhttp://www.eyecandyxotic.com\r\nhttp://www.londoncharles.com\r\nhttp://www.naughtyneshelle.com\r\nhttp://www.absolutelyamber.com\r\nhttp://www.annahourglass.com\r\nhttp://www.ataunleashed.com\r\n\r\nOne thread in particular blatantly brags about hacking our sites and\r\neven has\r\nit on its title \"EYECANDYMODELING THREAD (updated often)\"\r\nhttp://www.bikinibikini.com/forum/thread140538.html\r\n\r\nI've contacted these people several times and they NEVER responded to\r\nany of\r\nmy request to remove these posts. You can easily identify our images by\r\nour\r\nlogo \"ECM\" or the actual website url on the picture.  By ignoring our\r\nrequest\r\nto remove these threads on this message bored has cost us alot of\r\npotential\r\nmoney because their board members have in their mind to not sign up for\r\nour\r\nwebsite when they can just see all the pictures on this message board\r\nfor\r\nfree. This particular thread was created on 02-28-2007, 12:25 AM and its\r\nnow\r\nJune 1, 2007.  So its obvious nobody from www.bikinibikini.com cares\r\nabout our\r\nrequest and chose to keep ignoring us.  \r\n\r\nThis is my last attempt to resolve this before I seek legal action.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nAnthony Thomas\r\nPhenomenon Productions\r\nEye Candy The Magazine\r\nhttp://www.eyecandymodeling.com\r\nhttp://www.anthonythomasphotography.com\r\n","date_sent":"2007-06-01T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-06-01T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Phenomenon Productions (for Eye Candy The Magazine)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
