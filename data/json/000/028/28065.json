It has come to our\r\n| attention that your website pages bearing the URL above have been\r\n| copying, displaying, distributing, and/or linking to videotapes or their\r\n| digitized versions, containing likenesses of Carrie Tucker (?Videos?)\r\n| and still photographs containing likenesses of Carrie Tucker (?Photos?).\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| The Videos and Photos are all the exclusive copyrighted work of Ms.\r\n| Tucker.  Ms. Tucker's copyrights to the Videos and Photos have all been\r\n| filed for registration by the U.S. Copyright Office.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| I have a _good faith belief_ that your copying, displaying,\r\n| distributing, and/or linking to the Videos and Photos on the Internet\r\n| (or anywhere else) constitutes willful and unlawful infringement of Ms.\r\n| Tucker?s copyrights.  Neither Ms. Tucker, nor the Videos' co-producer\r\n| (see attached affidavit) has ever granted a license or permission of any\r\n| kind to any person or entity.  In addition, your linking to infringing\r\n| material or even posting without a link the addresses of sites with\r\n| infringing material will subject you to contributory copyright\r\n| infringement.  Furthermore, you have misappropriated Ms. Tucker?s name,\r\n| likeness and title which will subject you to additional liabilities and\r\n| penalties under federal and state statutory and common laws.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| We hereby demand that you immediately and permanently remove all Videos\r\n| and Photos containing likenesses of Ms. Tucker from all websites and\r\n| other media that you own or control and remove any and all links, URLs\r\n| and/or references to said infringing materials.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| Failure to do so will leave us no choice but to file suit against you\r\n| for injunction, damages, attorney?s fees and other penalties under the\r\n| DMCA, the Copyright Act and other federal and state laws without further\r\n| notice to you.  You probably know that these laws provide copyright\r\n| holders like Ms. Tucker with very strong remedies against, and that the\r\n| courts have dealt severely with, infringers like you under similar\r\n| circumstances.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| Please acknowledge to me by email (ptrjakab@yahoo.com\r\n| <http://mail.yahoo.com/config/login?/ym/Compose?To=ptrjakab@yahoo.com>)\r\n| or letter that:\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| 1.      you have permanently stopped using, publishing, distributing,\r\n| copying, displaying, linking to, selling, licensing or otherwise\r\n| exploiting the Videos and/or the Photos in any manner, including any\r\n| other websites that you are affiliated with;\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| 2.      you have destroyed all electronic and hard copies of the Videos\r\n| and Photos, including all system backups;\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| 3.      you have informed every identifiable person and entity who works\r\n| with you, or with your affiliated websites and companies, of the above\r\n| information;\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| 4.      an accounting of any and all monies that you and any affiliated\r\n| websites have received from the use, publishing, distribution, copying,\r\n| displaying and any other exploitation of the Videos and the Photos;\r\n|\r\n| 5.      a list of websites, with URLs and contact information, that you\r\n| are affiliated with or have linking agreements with;\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| 6.      the source including a list of names, e-mail addresses, and any\r\n| other contact information of those persons and/or other entities from\r\n| which you obtained the Videos and the Photos.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| I acknowledge that the above-stated information is true and accurate and\r\n| that I am authorized to act on behalf of the copyright holder, Ms. Tucker.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| /S/\r\n|\r\n| PETER JAKAB\r\n|\r\n| cc: Ms. Carrie Tucker\r\n|\r\n| ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|\r\n| PETER JAKAB\r\n|\r\n| FEIN & JAKAB\r\n|\r\n| ATTORNEYS AT LAW\r\n|\r\n| 233 BROADWAY ?
