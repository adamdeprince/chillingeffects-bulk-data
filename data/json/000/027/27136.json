They removed my copyright notice but left most of the\r\nother links intact, you can compare with my feed here:\r\nhttp://jobmob.co.il/feed/.<BR> \r\n<BR> \r\nDoing a reverse IP lookup after a whois lookup of clicks18.info, it\r\nappears that you are hosting the site, which means that clicks18.info is\r\nviolating your Acceptable Usage Policy in addition to the DMCA. <BR> \r\n<BR> \r\nPlease take appropriate action.
