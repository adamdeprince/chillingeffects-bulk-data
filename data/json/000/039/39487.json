(\"Western Union\") owns the famous\r\nWESTERN UNION family of trademarks and service marks, including the words WESTERN\r\nUNION alone or in combination with other wording or the \"double bar\" logo and design\r\n(the \"WESTERN UNION Mark(s)\"). Since 1856, Western Union, through its predecessors,\r\nhas used the WESTERN UNION Marks for various communication and financial services\r\nall over the world. Worldwide, Western Union owns over 720 U.S. and foreign\r\nregistrations for the WESTERN UNION Marks and over 150 pending applications for the\r\nWESTERN UNION Marks. The WESTERN UNION Marks have achieved substantial fame and good\r\nwill through Western Union's continuous and extensive use in international commerce.\r\n<BR>&nbsp;<BR>It has been brought to Western Union's attention that the WESTERN\r\nUNION Marks are being used on the website at <B>http://www.ezmedz.com/</B>, and\r\npossibly elsewhere, in connection with sales of pharmaceutical substances without\r\nprescription. Western Union is concerned that this unauthorized use of the WESTERN\r\nUNION Marks will confuse consumers as to whether Western Union somehow is associated\r\nwith, or approves of, <B>http://www.ezmedz.com/ </B>and/or the activities conducted\r\nthrough<B> http://www.ezmedz.com/.</B> Because importation, sale, distribution,\r\npossession, and use of such substances without proper prescriptions may be criminal\r\noffenses, Western Union is especially concerned that such use of the WESTERN UNION\r\nMarks may dilute the good will in the Marks. <I>See, e.g.,</I> Controlled Substances\r\nImport and Export Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7952 (prohibiting importation and sales of\r\ncontrolled pharmaceutical substances, subject to very specific exceptions).  \r\n<P align=left>\r\n<P align=left>\r\n<P align=left><STRONG><U>Western Union understands that you may not previously have\r\nbeen aware that such use of the WESTERN UNION Marks is not authorized and that it\r\nmay violate U.S. and international trademark laws. Accordingly, this letter is\r\nformal notification that Western Union cannot permit such unauthorized use of the\r\nWESTERN UNION Marks &nbsp;and a formal request that such use immediately\r\ncease.<BR></U></STRONG>&nbsp;<BR>Please ensure that the WESTERN UNION Marks\r\nimmediately are removed from the website at http://www.ezmedz.com/; that any print,\r\nelectronic, and other forms of promotional materials containing any form of the\r\nWESTERN UNION Marks and/or marks confusingly similar to the WESTERN UNION Marks\r\n(including uses in metatags, keywords or other \"ad triggers,\" postURL or forwarding\r\ncommands, hyperlinks, or any other electronic coding) are withdrawn from\r\npublication; and that you&nbsp;refrain from further use of any form of the WESTERN\r\nUNION Marks and/or marks confusingly similar thereto. We stress that the WESTERN\r\nUNION Marks include the words \"WESTERN UNION\" and/or the initials \"WU\" alone, the\r\nWESTERN UNION double-bar logo, and the distinctive WESTERN UNION golden yellow and\r\nblack trade dress ? as well as any variants, abbreviations, or misspellings of\r\n\"WESTERN UNION.\" <BR>&nbsp;<BR>We shall look forward soon to receiving your written\r\nresponse to our notification and request.
