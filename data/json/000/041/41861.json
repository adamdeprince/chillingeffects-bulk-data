Based on our investigation it appears that the\r\noffer for certifications is unauthorized and unrelated to Microsoft, and\r\nlikely constitutes an improper attempt to deceive customers into paying\r\nsubstantial sums of money by indicating that their certification\r\nachieved via such proxy-testing is legitimate and/or authorized by\r\nMicrosoft.\r\n \r\nAs you know, illegal on-line activities can be highly damaging for the\r\nvictims.
