Because you should now have both full and\r\nconstructive knowledge about said activities, your continued support and\r\nfostering of such infringing activities eliminates any safe harbor defenses\r\nunder the DMCA and you can and will be hell fully liable as a contributory\r\ninfringer for any future infringements related to your hosting of websites\r\nfeaturing celebrity photos.","date_sent":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Barry Rosen","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
