My company, Cyberspace To Paradise, Inc.,\r\nd.b.a. Harris Digital Publishing, Inc. owns all trademarks and service\r\nmarks related to Net Detective and Harris Digital Publishing. Someone has\r\nstolen our corporate website material and is hosting it at 67.19.247.204.\r\n\r\nI was told by \"Mike Vu\", \"team leader\" of the technical support department\r\nwho answered the phone at the abuse number listed in your Arin output that\r\nI could not and would not be transfered to the appropriate abuse\r\ndepartment and that I MUST email this information as it was too \"petty\" to\r\ndisturb his manager. According to Arin's policy there must be \"accurate\r\nupstream Abuse and Technical POCs visible on the WHOIS record for that\r\nblock.\"\r\n\r\nI must have this person shut down immediately as this site is stealing\r\nmoney and resources from our company.
