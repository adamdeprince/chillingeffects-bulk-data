It  \ncontains; incorrect statements about our products - Coffee used is Arabica\n \nand fairtrade; abusive comments about the owner - 'a nut job' and accusing\n \nus of posting own reveiws etc. We believe but cannot prove that the source\n \nis a competitor who has been waging a campaign of vilification for over  \nthree years.\n\nplease remove again.\n\nWhat an unimaginitive place. Even the name is so literal, only thing more \n\npedestrian is the actual Tea. No brewing method, just hot water on a bag. \n\nOld Ladies at a church canteen know more about tea brewing and temp\ncontrol  \nthan this sloppy middle of the road boredom box. Populated with an owner  \n\nwho is clearly a nut job. When I was here she was ripping into another  \ncustomer. I've heard similar anecdotal stories from friends who live in\nthe  \narea. Looks like the owner is using google to write own reviews too. The  \n\ncoffee isn't fairtrade or Arabica and tastes bitter and badly made  \naccording to a friend in the know.
