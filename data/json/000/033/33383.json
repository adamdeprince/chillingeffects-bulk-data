Don\u2019t post reviews based on someone  \nelse\u2019s experience, or that are not about the specific place you are  \nreviewing. Reviews are not a forum for personal rants or crusades. Don\u2019t  \nuse reviews to report incorrect information about a place--use the Report a  \nproblem link for that place instead.\n\nThe majority of low reviews are opinions formulated from a photo series  \nmocking human advertising which was sensationalized by the media. These are  \npersonal opinions not reviews on services or encounters within the  \nbusiness. Which in turn is abusive toward the staff members of this salon.  \nAfter receiving many death threats from individuals who did not understand  \nthe facts behind these photos. It adds insult to injury to be plagued with  \nhorrible reviews from people who have never been to the salon or received a  \nservice from the salon. They violate googles policy. These reviews should  \nbe removed.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/103996630131814935383/about?hl=en"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
