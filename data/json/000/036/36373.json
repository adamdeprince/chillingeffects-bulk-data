Electronic signature attached as JPG. -- Roy Camp  9/21/2004\r\n\r\n2. The copyright and trademark infringement comprises the material appearing\r\non http://www.chattingaimbot.com.  Specific URL's will be given when\r\nidentifying each infringement on the offending site.\r\n\r\n3. Copyright Infringements:\r\nAll of the data below has been verified as of 9/27/2004.\r\n\r\n-- We understand that there is nothing wrong with someone creating a\r\ncompeting duplicate of our service.  We do feel that the entire look and\r\nfeel of\r\ntheir website is very mimicking of ours.  Being the service, as well as the\r\nlook\r\nand feel, are exactly the same we are afraid that visitors that are looking\r\nfor\r\nour site, may find their site and think we have merely made some design\r\nchanges. By visiting http://www.aimprank.com you will see their \"use bot\"\r\nform.\r\n This is an exact copy of our form found at\r\nhttp://chattingaimbot.com/?p=useb\r\nwith minor changes.  They have also mimicked our \"bot status\" page further\r\ncompounding the issue.  You can see this by comparing\r\nhttp://aimprank.com/bot_status.php to ours at\r\nhttp://chattingaimbot.com/?p=status.\r\n\r\n-- The following are phrases that the bot says (The service we both provide\r\nallows you to have a bot[computer] talk to your friend) when the\r\nconversation\r\nhas been completed for one reason or another.  These phrases are unique\r\nphrases we have developed and modified over the past year as part of\r\nmarketing\r\nour service and bringing visitors back to our website.  There are two\r\nseparate\r\ninfringements.  In both case's they have been slightly modified (A couple\r\nwords different with a different URL) but it is still very clear it is\r\ninfringing of our marketing message's.\r\n*The only way to see this for yourself is to signon AOL or AOL Instant\r\nMessenger and have the bot's from both service's talk to you. For\r\nconvenience I\r\nhave taken a screenshot of both our's and his phrase's, but feel free to\r\ntest\r\nthe service's on yourself to verify the screenshots.*\r\n\r\nThis is our final message: http://chattingaimbot.com/chatbot1.jpg\r\nThis is their copied final message: http://chattingaimbot.com/aimprank1.jpg\r\nA majority is exactly copied.\r\n\r\nThis is our \"user did not respond\" message:\r\nhttp://chattingaimbot.com/chatbot2.jpg\r\nThis is their copied \"user did not respond\" message:\r\nhttp://chattingaimbot.com/aimprank2.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nWe want all of the above infringements to be fixed immediately as well as\r\nimmediate cease and desist of mimicking the \"Chatting AIM Bot(s)\"'s \"use\r\nbot\" and \"status\" page, look and feel;  We are requesting the bot status\r\npage be\r\nremoved altogether.  If these change's cannot be be done or\r\nwill not be done immediately we request the website,\r\nhttp://www.aimprank.com, be\r\ntaken offline until proper change's are made.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance in this manner of protecting \"Chatting AIM\r\nBot(s)\"'s valuable intellectual property rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther Information about the offender:\r\nURL: http://www.aimprank.com\r\nIP of website: 69.93.73.98\r\nInformation gathered from domain whois:\r\nDemers, Morgan\r\n MindViz\r\n500 East Ave.\r\nSuite 5G\r\nRochester, NY  14610\r\nUS\r\n585-586-3072\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

Below is the original (formal) DMCA I filed with ev1\r\nas\r\n> well as what the current status of the infringements are.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Current Status (After reading the DMCA below this should make more sense):\r\n>\r\n> I have reviewed the offending site and confirmed the \"Chatting AIM Bot(s)\"\r\n> trademark infringements have been removed.  I checked to see if the \"no\r\n> response\" and \"you have been pranked\" message's were changed (the ones the\r\n> bot\r\n> say) and they have not been changed.  I have found the change's\r\n> made to the \"use bot\" form found at http://www.aimprank.com to be somewhat\r\n> unsatisfactory.  Further more, the \"status page\"\r\n> http://aimprank.com/bot_status.php\r\n> still looks exactly the same as ours,\r\n> http://www.chattingaimbot.com/?p=status\r\n> He can fully operate his service as normal without the copied \"status\r\npage\".\r\n> I\r\n> am requesting the status page be fully removed from public view to stop\r\nany\r\n> confusion between his site and ours.  I have a feeling he did not change\r\nthe\r\n> message's the bot says because he knew ev1 would not sign onto AOL/AIM and\r\n> check... Then he moved servers to get ev1 off his back and thinking I\r\nwould\r\n> not\r\n> follow him.  Thank you for your assistance with this situation.
