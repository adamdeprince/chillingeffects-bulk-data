This Website is illegally publishing\r\nstolen passwords, aimed at unauthorized access to my paysites, and\r\nunauthorized access of thousands of paysites around the world. This\r\nviolation is a serious crime and I'm hoping you will provide assistance\r\nregarding this issue. I have tryed contacting SH3LLS.NET (their hosting\r\ncompany) a couple times, but did not receive a reply, it looks like they\r\nare running the website theirselves. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe illegal website requires a free registration, once you have\r\nregistered an account you may login and go to the following url,\r\nhttp://www.silverpassboard.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=12) to enter the\r\nillegal section.\r\nAfter that click on one of the topics to see the illegal breached\r\npasswords. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTo make it easy for you i will provide you a username/password so you do\r\nnot have to register. \r\nPlease follow the following steps to access the illegal passwords, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLogin at the following url, \r\nhttp://www.silverpassboard.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=12\r\nUsername: aftereight\r\npassword: test \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThen go to the following sample of a topic containing the illegal\r\npasswords: \r\nhttp://www.silverpassboard.com/forum/showthread.php?t=12363\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBut that isn't all. They also have a private copyrighted picture section\r\nwhere they provide links to copyrighted content. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttp://www.silverpassboard.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=35\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nQuick action to eliminate this lawbreaker would be beneficial for\r\neveryone, including you. As a hosting provider who eliminates\r\nuntrustworthy clients from your database, you'll enjoy good publicity,\r\ngain a reputation as a provider who cares about copyright laws, and save\r\nyourself from dealing with any lawyers. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your cooperation. I look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you about this serious issue. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDavid Aminari\r\ncontact@alecy.com","date_sent":"2007-02-28T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-28T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
