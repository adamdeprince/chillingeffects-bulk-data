VegetarianUSA.com is quite popular amongst natural health websites, and has received approx. 500,000 visitors each year since 2000. One of them is currently available on the Google search engine. It is called www.gototour.com.\r\n\r\nYou can see examples of the a few of the over 150 web pages that are being cloned here:\r\n\r\nOriginal page: http://www.vegetarianusa.com/city/California.html\r\nGototour.com clone:http://www.gototour.com/city/California.html\r\n\r\nOriginal page: http://www.vegetarianusa.com/city/Florida.html\r\nGototour.com clone: http://www.gototour.com/city/Florida.html\r\n\r\nOriginal page: http://www.vegetarianusa.com/vacationmapaz.html\r\nGototour.com clone: http://www.gototour.com/vacationmapaz.html\r\n\r\nAs more proof of me being the originator of the site, there is a page showing me in a photo with my mother Pamela Firk, Angelie Delate (a friend) and a yoga teacher we interviewed for the site (Swami Satchidananda). It clearly states in the caption that I am the webmaster (they have removed the link to my bio page).\r\nOriginal page:\r\nhttp://www.vegetarianusa.com/feature_articles/yoga/swami_satchidanada.html\r\ngototour.com clone...\r\nhttp://www.gototour.com/feature_articles/yogalswami_satchidanada.html\r\n\r\nIf you go to their home page http://www.gototour.com, you can see they have cloned over 150 pages of my websiteVegetarianUSA.com. By clicking on the USA map (identical to the one on our VegetarianUSA.com home page), you can go to many state pages. To the left of the map are text links to cities within their site. Quite a few links cannot be found on the home page, as they are located only on pages within the site (i.e. feature articles, glossary, etc.). Please respond as to whether or not I have to send a complete list of urls from gototour.com that need to be removed from the Google search.\r\n\r\nTheir current contact information is:\r\nRegistrant:\r\nDomains by Proxy, Inc. | DomainsByProxy.com\r\n15111 N.
