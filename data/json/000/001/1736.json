Mr. Yoder and I became aware recently of the illegal use of three of his images that appear prominently at http://amishwoodworking.com.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of my letter is to inform you your use of three of his images to create the connection between Amish Woodworking, the furniture that you sell, the Amish lifestyle and the reputation of the Amish for excellent craftsmanship is not a licensed use. You have illegally used three images (the company logo image that you use to advertise and promote your company, Amish Woodworking; the icon created from the Amish buggy framed against the sunset and the Amish harvest wagon used at the front page).
