Pursuant to the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), which is codified at 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512, upon receiving such notification, Cox is required to \"act expeditiously to remove, or disable access to\" the infringing material in order to avoid liability for any alleged copyright infringement.  Accordingly, Cox will suspend your account and disable your connection to the Internet within 24 hours of your receipt of this email if the offending material is not removed.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that the DMCA also provides procedures by which a subscriber accused of copyright violation can respond to the allegations of infringement and, under certain circumstances, cause his or her account to be reinstated.  To do so, however, the response must meet certain criteria.  Pursuant to section (g) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(g)), you have the right to submit to Cox a counter-notification which, to be effective, must include the following elements:  \r\n\r\n(a)\ta physical or electronic signature of the subscriber; \r\n(b)\tidentification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled; \r\n(c)\ta statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; \r\n(d)\tthe subscriber\u0092s name, address, and telephone number and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located.\r\n\r\nIn the event that you submit to Cox a counter-notification that includes these elements, Cox will forward your counter notification to the complainant and advise them that Cox will cease disabling access to the allegedly infringing material in ten (10) business days.  Unless the complainant notifies us that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in the allegedly infringing activity prior to the expiration of those ten (10) business days, Cox will reactivate your account.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nThe Cox Abuse Team\r\n\r\n--- The following material was provided to us as evidence ---\r\n\r\n\r\n[Part 0 (plain text)]\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\nCox Communications\r\n\r\nNotice ID:53161\r\nNotice  Date:13 Aug 2003 18:22:05 GMT\r\n\r\nDear Sir or Madam:\r\n\r\nBayTSP, Inc.
