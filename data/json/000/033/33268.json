The \r\nowner of this site tradercd.com has stolen my software \r\nand has made it available at a fraction of its \r\nlegitimate price.  (See \r\nhttp://www.tradercd.com/whymarketsturn.html) \r\nApparently this pirate is victimizing 193 companies \r\nhttp://www.tradercd.com/full.html \r\n \r\nAs such, TRADERCD.COM is encouraging and facilitating \r\ntheft and fraud against WhyMarketsTurn.com. This is \r\nclearly in violation of your own policy as well as \r\nillegal. As such, I demand that you immediately shut \r\ndown this website and that you provide us with contact \r\ninformation for the real registrant of tradercd.com \r\npursuant to your customer agreement.  \r\n \r\nWe would also like to see a list of other domain names \r\nthis person has registered with you and those of \r\nWEBHOSTINGOUTSOURCING.COM so that we can confirm \r\nwhether they also violate WhyMarketsTurn.com's rights. \r\n \r\nWhyMarketsTurn insists that this website be shut down \r\nwithin 48 hours of receipt of this letter, and that \r\nyou contact me within five days of receipt of this \r\nletter to provide contact information for the \r\nregistrant of tradercd.com. Thank you for your \r\nanticipated cooperation in this matter. \r\n \r\nVery truly yours, \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nDan Morikawa \r\nadmin@whymarketsturn.com ","date_sent":"2007-01-07T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-07T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Dan Morikawa","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
