If you believe it won\u2019t work, then it won\u2019t.\r\nWhen you begin to turn your negative thoughts around with some positive self talk, you will begin to get what you want. Whatever that might be.\r\nIt\u2019s like having your mother criticize you all the time.\r\nWere there any negative people in your childhood? What were they saying to you? You might be walking around saying negative things to yourself without even realizing it. You might be repeating the very things that they said to you because you internalized their comments.\r\nYour mother has a profound impact on your development and if she was critical, you may still be hearing her critical voice. It may have become your own voice. This negative self talk keeps you from realizing your goals.\r\nChange Your Mind With Self Hypnosis\r\nChanging your mind so that you develop a positive attitude with positive thoughts can be done with self hypnosis. It is just a simple matter of training your mind to have positive self talk. You do this with a little practice.\r\nI am not talking about pretending to be optimistic.\r\n\r\nYou can become an optimistic person with a positive attitude.\r\nYou can become the kind of person that notices the opportunities around you and responds to them in a positive way.\r\nYou can become the kind of positive person that people enjoy being around.\r\n\r\nYou will be more likely to do the things you want when you begin to see the possibilities are there for you and not just for others.\r\nHow would your life improve if you weren\u2019t so hard on yourself? Imagine how much better you would feel if you were to say \u201cI am going to make this happen.\u201d\r\nSelf hypnosis is the key to changing your negativity into positive self talk. It is so simple to sit back and relax while you listen to a guided positive thinking self hypnosis audio. You will easily change your patterns of thinking so that you can respond in a new and useful way.\r\nAfter all, if we don\u2019t talk to ourselves nicely, who will?

Here is a portion of my original content:\r\n\r\nAirplane turbulence, for those with a fear of flying phobia, is the worst part of the flight.\r\nNo need to be afraid though when you understand what it\u2019s all about.\r\nThe bumpiness that we feel in an airplane when flying through clouds is just the movement of the air. The warm and cool air sort of collide and it creates a bouncy ride.\r\nNo one enjoys airplane turbulence (especially when you have a fear of flying phobia). It seems to always strike as soon as the flight attendant serves me my Diet Coke. I watch the ice slurp around in the cup and hope it doesn\u2019t spill on my lap. Too hard to even take a sip sometimes. The pilot announces that we have to fasten our seatbelts and stay in our seats. It\u2019s the safest thing we can do and gives us some measure of control.\r\nYou want to feel in control!\r\nThat\u2019s what this fear is really about anyway, isn\u2019t it? At least many times, it\u2019s about feeling out of control. When we fly, we are not in control of the situation.\r\n\r\nSometimes there\u2019s turbulence and there aren\u2019t even any clouds around. Instead of clouds, there might be mountains. Inside of all the peaks and vallies of the mountains are areas that are warm and areas that are cool. Just like in the clouds, the warm and cool air moves around, remember warm air rises and cool air falls.\r\nWe may not like airplane turbulence, it tends to cause more flying anxiety, but at least it\u2019s not a safety issue.\r\nYou might take a deep breath and say a prayer but you\u2019re going to be all right. Especially if you are wearing your seatbelt.\r\nWhen pilots know there is going to be a turbulent area up ahead, they adjust their path to avoid if at all possible. So most of the time the passengers are blissfully unaware of it. Sometimes, it\u2019s unexpected and can\u2019t be avoided.\r\nI, for one, am happy to know that pilots train twice a year to handle this and other circumstances that arise.\r\nKnowledge is power and the more I know about what goes on behind the scenes in the cockpit, the more at ease I feel. The easier it is to overcome fear of flying.\r\nAfter all, the pilots enjoy a nice smooth ride too.\r\nIf you are ready to overcome fear of flying, I suggest you use the proven techniques of self hypnosis.\r\nAll my best,\r\n\r\np.s. See all that we\u2019ve included in this hypnosis mp3 program to overcome fear of flying.\r\n\r\nCopyright \u00a9 2003-2012 Pro Power Services, Inc.

Here is a portion of my original content:\r\n\r\nAirplane turbulence has a bad reputation for those who are afraid to fly.\r\nThe reason that airplane turbulence takes the blame is because it touches your senses in a very real way. You FEEL the plane moving around differently. You SEE the coffee cup shaking. You HEAR the pilot tell you to fasten your seat belt.\r\nIt\u2019s enough to make you even more afraid to fly.\r\nWhat causes the turbulence and how much of a safety problem is it?\r\nAs a child, did you ever lay back on a lazy day and watch the clouds drift by? I spent countless hours imagining different shapes in the clouds. In fact, I still look up at the clouds and see a face or an animal.\r\nIt\u2019s a different story when we fly through the clouds. Those creamy white clouds don\u2019t seem to like getting run over by an airplane.\r\nThe bumpiness that we feel in an airplane when flying through clouds is just the movement of the air. It\u2019s an updraft of going from warm air to cool air and it creates a bouncy ride.\r\nYou might wonder why you feel airplane turbulence and you haven\u2019t even noticed any clouds.\r\nI know that\u2019s when your flying anxiety really kicks in.\r\nInstead of clouds, you might see mountains.\r\n\r\nThere is something called \u2018mountain waves\u2019 which also creates turbulence. Within all the nooks and valleys of a mountain range are variations of temperatures. Thinking back to science class you\u2019ll remember that warm air rises. All these variations of temperatures are moving and circulating which creates turbulence.\r\nDoes airplane turbulence create an air safety problem?\r\nYou may not like mild turbulence. If you have a fear of flying, it may cause you to grip your armrest until your knuckles are white. Your heart may beat faster or your stomach may knot up in discomfort. But it does not cause any kind of air safety issue.\r\nThe chance of a flight safety problem is very slight. Pilots are well trained to handle the situation because we practice and rehearse this very situation twice a year in a simulator. Hands on experience with turbulence tells us it\u2019s time to make some changes not only for flight safety but also for the comfort of our passengers.\r\nWhen I hit turbulence, I simply check in with the air traffic controllers and ask if other pilots have reported smoother altitudes. Then I\u2019ll slow down and go to the altitude where I\u2019m likely to find less bumps.\r\nSo, what can you do when turbulence strikes? Stay in your seat with your seat belt fastened. We\u2019ll be moving to a smoother air space as fast as we can.\r\nThe pilots don\u2019t want a bumpy ride either.\r\nYou know there is going to be airplane turbulence during the flight, so if you are afraid to fly there are ways to prepare before the flight so that you won\u2019t be worried.\r\nAre you ready to get started? I recommend that you use the proven techniques of self hypnosis and NLP in this audio download to Overcome Fear of Flying.
