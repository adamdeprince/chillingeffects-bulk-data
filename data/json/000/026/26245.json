He has illegally\r\ninstalled the software on this domain and is marketing/selling the\r\nsoftware as his own! \r\n\r\n\r\nBackground Information\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------\r\nOn Mar. 6 2007 customer purchased license for product from my shopping\r\ncart web site using PayPal (transaction details below). The license\r\ngranted him access to install and run the software on one domain with no\r\nresell or rights of ownership (\r\nhttp://phprealestatescript.com/terms.html). On March 9th 2007 customer\r\nrequest a refund for product in accordance to the refund policy listed\r\nin the software license agreement (sections 10, 11).  A full refund was\r\nprocessed on March 9th 2007, at that time customer had 10 days to\r\ndiscontinue use of software in accordance to section 11 of the license\r\nagreement. \r\n\r\nOn May 4 2007 I was notified by another developer (Klemen Stirn) that my\r\nsoftware was being illegally sold on\r\n(http://www.ypninc.com/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=11 ). On\r\nMay 4 2007 I send a notice to support@ypninc.com to immediately remove\r\nthat software. On May 4 2007 I received a reply back from\r\nsupport@ypninc.com notifying me that he had purchased a license on\r\ne-bay. I replied back notifying him that my product is not sold on e-bay\r\nand that the license that he purchase is invalid (if it existed). I\r\nchecked e-bay for any software packages that may contain my product with\r\nno results. I then ran a history check for his email address and\r\ndiscovered the transactions noticed above. Meaning he obtained the\r\nsoftware via these transactions. \r\n\r\nI sent another email on May 7 2007 to support@ypninc.com notifying him\r\nof the transactions and giving him 48 hours to remove the software from\r\nhis website. To this date nothing has been removed and no promise of\r\nremoval has been received. \r\n\r\nPurchase Transaction\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------\r\nPayPal Trans ID: 1UJ06215MX461632W \r\nCustomer's PayPal Email Address: support@ypninc.com\r\n\r\nRefunded Transaction\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n------------- \r\nRefund (ID #01E5619444753250L)\r\nIn reference to: 1UJ06215MX461632W\r\n<https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_history-details&info=g4J9\r\nL8_cB7HuBF3nMGpOFlX5FMd4IL5-ExhnK1edErmFXFdmplpkKKYKnX4&history_cache=&s\r\nearch_trans_id=> \r\nCustomer's PayPal Email Address: support@ypninc.com\r\n\r\nRequest for removal of illegally posted/installed software and\r\ncopyrighted text. \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n----------------------------------------\r\nThis is a request for you to remove the the illegally installed software\r\nhere: http://realestate.ypninc.com/index.php\r\nThis is also a request for your to remove the copyrighted text posted\r\nhere: http://www.ypninc.com/store/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=11 \r\n\r\n\r\nI thank you in advance for your urgent notice to this matter.
