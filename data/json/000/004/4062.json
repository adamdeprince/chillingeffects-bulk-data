I have reserved all rights in the Work, which was first published in December 2002, and I have registered the copyright.\r\n\r\nTheir works entitled http://www.business-grants.org & http://www.govemment-grants.ws are essentially identical to www.freegovmoney.net and clearly used the www.freegovmoney.net as their basis.\r\n\r\nThey neither asked for nor received permission to use www.freegovmoney.net as the basis for http://www.business-grants.org & http://www.government-grants.ws nor to make or distribute copies of it. Therefore, I believe they have willfully infringed my rights under 17 USC Section 101, et seq. and could be liable for statutory damages as high as $100,000.\r\n\r\nWhen doing a search on the Google search engine the domain http://www.businessgrants.org appears on your Search Engine Results Pages under keyword phrases such as \"free government grants.\" If you click on the link for http://www.business-grants.org you are actually re-directed to www.government-grants.org.
