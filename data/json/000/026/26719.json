Four Key Communication Tips \r\n \r\nWhen the collector's calling, these four key communication tips are \r\nnecessary to successful resolve the issue and keep your sanity. \r\n \r\n1. Set your goals for the communication prior to beginning the \r\nconversation or letter. What do you what to accomplish? If you want a \r\npayment plan, the collector is going to need to know your financial info\r\n\r\nto be able to justify it to his boss. If you want a settlement, the \r\ncollector will have to know why one is justified. For more information\r\non \r\nnegotiating goals, see my article on negotiating. \r\n \r\nWhen you have your goal for the conversation in mind, you can anticipate\r\n\r\nwhat the collector will want to know or ask. This will allow you to\r\nsteer \r\nthe conversation and guide it toward what you want. If the collector\r\ncalls \r\nand you aren't ready \" tell him that you need a minute and pull your \r\nthoughts together. \r\n \r\n2. Organize Your Thoughts. You know what your goal is. Now set up a \r\nlogical progression for the call. Keep the conversation moving toward\r\nyour \r\ngoal. Don't introduce distractions and don't follow the side path the \r\ncollector will layout for you. But above all remember, if you don't know\r\n\r\nwhat you are going to say, you probably won't say what you want. \r\n \r\n3. Talk to the collector. That doesn't mean allow them to berate, insult\r\n\r\nor harass you. If you are being mistreated on the phone, tell them how\r\nyou \r\nare feeling and if they don't change their tune \" END the call. However,\r\n\r\nthat also means don't threaten, insult or yell at him either. If the \r\nconversation goes bad \" just hang up. An argument will not help you. \r\n \r\nThat said, if the collector doesn't know your situation, he can't go to \r\nbat for you with his manager. And if you don't communicate well, he\r\nwon't. \r\nYou need to provide the supporting information for the goal you set in \r\nstep one. If you can only pay $25 a month, you will have to justify that\r\n\r\nto the collector. If you can't make it sound reasonable, it isn't going \r\nfly. But remember, the collector works on commission. If you make the \r\npayment plan reasonable and support your goal with facts and figures \r\nregarding your economic position, he will take the payment and move on\r\nto \r\nthe next account. \r\n \r\n4. Relax. Inhale. You have just been through a stressful situation. And,\r\n\r\nit is the collector's job to make it a little more stressful if you\r\naren't \r\npaying. After you hang up with the collector don't talk to your family\r\nfor \r\nat least a minute. Just pause and remember, nobody is going to die over \r\nthis. While it is important, don't let a debt destroy your relationship \r\nwith your family. You will not get the result you wanted in one call \" \r\nmost times. Follow my negotiating tips and you will be driving the\r\nprocess \r\ninstead of being driven. \r\n \r\nKeep track of your calls, who you talked to and about what. You cannot \r\ntake too many notes while you are opening the lines of communication and\r\n\r\nnegotiating a debt. \r\n \r\n<< END STOLEN CONTENT >> \r\n \r\nI am copying this message to your hosting company and to your domain \r\nregistar.
