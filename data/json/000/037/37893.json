(\"Nelnet\") is the owner of the federally registered trademark\r\n\"NELNET\" Reg. # 2510521.  It has come to our attention recently that a Web\r\nsite hosted by your company, located at the url\r\nwww.nelnet.collegeplanning.net is using the Nelnet trademark as a purported\r\nlink to \"Student Loan,\" \"College,\" and \"College Planning,\" among other\r\nrelated links,  when in reality a user selecting that link is redirected to\r\npage with numerous links on it, thus giving the user the impression of an\r\naffiliation between those organizations and Nelnet, which do not exist, and\r\nin turn diverting business away from Nelnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis use of the Nelnet trademark is unauthorized and deceptive and likely to\r\ncreate confusion among consumers.  Accordingly, we are writing to inform you\r\nof this unauthorized use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause these activities are clear violations of your organizations' Terms\r\nof Use and Acceptable Use policies, we request your cooperation in demanding\r\nthat you cease and desist this activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact the undersigned on or before December 15, 2005 to advise us\r\nof your intended actions.  If we do not receive your response we will\r\nproceed to exercise all rights and remedies available to us with all due\r\nhaste.  You may contact me at:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Nelnet Corporation\r\n\r\n          3015 S.
