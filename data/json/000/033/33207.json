We have noticed that the site\r\nhttp://www.nortechsatelliteservices.co.uk/index.html is offering\r\nsatellite viewing cards for sale. \r\n \r\nThe viewing cards for sale are for the channels ART/MBC which are the\r\nMiddle Eastern and North African broadcasters for the FA Premier League.\r\nIt is illegal for these channels to be broadcast out of their respective\r\nterritories and by offering them outside of these markets; NORTECH\r\nSatellite Services is offering an illegal service to customers. \r\n \r\nThe site is selling illegal satellite viewing cards for ART and in turn\r\nthis enables viewers that purchase the cards to view FA Premier League\r\nbroadcasts illegally. \r\n \r\nPlease immediately cease all such infringements on any and all of your\r\nweb sites and confirm to us via email that you have done so. \r\n \r\nI have attached a copy of a letter from ART that references how and when\r\nit's viewing cards can and cannot be used. \r\n \r\nPlease contact me with any questions. \r\n \r\nKindest regard, \r\n \r\n  \r\nTim Cooper \r\n \r\nNetResult\r\nA Division of Projector NetResult Ltd\r\nMulberry House\r\n583 Fulham Road\r\nLondon\r\nUK SW6 5UA \r\n \r\nTel: +44 (0)20 7471 1735\r\nHead Office: Projector NetResult Ltd, 8 Wye Street, Hereford, UK HR2 7RB\r\n\r\n \r\nPlease note, if this email has been sent to the wrong recipient, please\r\naccept our apologies, inform us of the error, and forward this e-mail\r\nimmediately to the correct person or department for action. \r\n \r\n \r\nMIME element (application/pdf) \r\nMIME element (text/plain)\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-01-10T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-10T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"NetResult (for FA Premier League)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
