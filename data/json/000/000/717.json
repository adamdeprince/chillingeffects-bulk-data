{"dmca":{"id":717,"type":"Dmca","title":"Hire Rite or Rong?","body":"Dear [Private]\r\n\r\nWe received your letter addressing the infringement matter relating to the HIRERIGHT mark of our client, HireRight, Inc. Although the letter indicates that the offending web page, http://www.hirerite.com is no longer available on the Internet, we have found evidence that the domain name is still being used through various search engines to direct customers to your client's site, which continues to create confusion in the marketplace. Specifically, we have found references directing customers to your client's web site on \"aol\" and \"msn\". This does not resolve the matter. There is still confusion in the marketplace as customers are intending to reach my client, but instead accessing [your] site.\r\n\r\nAs a final resolution to this matter, we again request that your client agree to transfer the domain name \"hirerite.com\" to my client and cease infringing on our client's intellectual property rights in any manner or context.\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what information your client needs to bring this matter to complete resolution. We appreciate you assistance regarding this matter,","date_sent":"2002-03-20T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-03-20T05:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":"St. George & Carnegie","principal_name":"Hire Right, Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
