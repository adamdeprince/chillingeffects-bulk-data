(I really hope\r\nthat makes sense).  The Web host in question is ProNetSpace.com.  The\r\nfolks stealing my content are at Firefoxplus.com.  Firefoxplus.com has\r\nbeen stealing my content left and right from FirefoxFacts.com. I want to\r\nknow what you can do to shut them down for stealing and reposting my\r\nintellectual property.  I have contacted the offender, the offender's\r\nWeb host and you thus far to hopefully get a resolution from one of you\r\nsoon.  Thank you for your time and hopefully we can get this resolved as\r\nsoon as possible.  \r\nThanks! \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMitch Keeler - http://www.mitchkeeler.com ","date_sent":"2007-01-28T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-28T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Mitch Keeler","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
