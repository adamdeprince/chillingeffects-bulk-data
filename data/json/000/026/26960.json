The following are guidelines taken from the advice booklet produced by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.\r\n\r\nWhen you feel a tremor\u2026\r\n\r\nIf you are inside, try to open windows or doors to ensure you have a clear exit when the tremor stops.\r\nIf you are outside, try to find an open space away from potential falling glass, walls or trees \u2013 best options are public parks or school playground areas.\r\nKnow where your fire extinguishers are so that you can quickly put out any fires that start. No extinguisher? Try and douse any small fires with blankets.\r\nTry to get into a space that will protect you from falling objects. If you are sat at a desk then get under it.\r\nDo not get in a lift/elevator. Always use emergency exit stairs.\r\nTurn off any gas mains and electrical circuit breakers.\r\nIf you are outside, protect your head in any way that you can. If you are carrying a handbag, anything that will provide some cushion from falling objects, put it on your head.\r\nIf you are near the sea or large bodies of water, move to higher ground in case of tsunami.\r\nIf you are in a hotel or apartment, if you have the opportunity, run a bath of water. This may prove essential after the event.\r\nback to top\r\n\r\nEarthquake Emergency Kits\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to have a small earthquake emergency kit on stand by in your hotel room or apartment just in case. This kit should contain the following basic items if possible:\r\n\r\nDrinking water in pet bottles \u2013 enough for 3 days for the size of your party\r\nFood \u2013 packs or tins of non-perishable food\r\nHigh energy glucose tablets\r\nSome basic medicines such as antiseptic cream, band aids, and painkillers\r\nTorch\r\nPlastic rain coats\r\nCandles\r\nWhistle\r\nWet tissues\r\nThe above are just guidelines but they are some of the essential items you will need should a major Tokyo earthquake occur. If you think we have missed something that should be included, please let us know and we will gladly add it. Last but not least, try not to panic ^_^\r\n\r\nback to top\r\n\r\nTypes of Earthquake\r\n\r\nThe shaking of the earth caused by an earthquake produces 2 kinds of movement.\r\n\r\nThe side-to-side movement, called P waves or compression waves, causes buildings and man made structures to sway. Of course, if the quake is strong enough then the degree of sway may become too much causing structural damage.\r\n\r\nThe second, and most deadly, is an up-and-down movement caused by S waves or shear waves. This sudden jolting causes buildings to effectively jump in the air \u2013 how high depends again on the magnitude of the quake. Just as with gymnastics, you hope your building scores a perfect 10 and lands squarely back on its foundations.\r\n\r\nBoth types of waves occur in most earthquakes, normally the P wave is felt first which gives you a good guess at how bad the earthquake will be. The S waves follow on behind and this is when you hope for the best!\r\n\r\nThe Miraikan Museum (Future Science Musuem) in Odaiba has a good exhibit showing how seismographs collect data across Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese and Taiwanese also have a different system for measuring the scale of an earthquake in addition to the widely used Richter scale. It is called the Shindo scale and it measures the degree of shaking that occurs.\r\n\r\nback to top","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://breakingnewssite.net/3256_tokyo-earthquake-information-and-guidelines-so-youll-be.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.tokyotopia.com/tokyo-earthquake.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
