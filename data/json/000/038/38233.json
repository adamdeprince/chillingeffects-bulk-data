RTC is the owner of the confidential Advanced Technology of the\r\nScientology\r\nreligion and the holder of exclusive rights under the copyrights applicable\r\nto the\r\nAdvanced Technology materials.  The Advanced Technology materials are\r\nconfidential,\r\nunpublished, copyrighted works.  RTC's works include, among others, the\r\nindividual\r\nworks comprising a level known as \"OT III\".  These works are registered with\r\nthe United\r\nStates Copyright Office under registration number: TXu 290 496.\r\n\r\n     We have been advised that one of The Planet's subscribers has placed\r\nRTC's OT\r\nIII copyrighted works on The Planet's web site without its authorization.\r\nThese works\r\ncan be found under the following URLs:\r\n\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/croyance-lrh.jpg          \r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/images/croyance-ot3.jpg\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/nouveau_fichier110.htm\r\n     http://www.anti-scientologie.ch/nouveau_xxxx.htm#H\r\n\r\n     Your subscriber's action in this regard violates United States\r\ncopyright law. \r\nAccordingly, we request your help in removing these copyrighted works.\r\n  \r\n     Our clients have obtained numerous permanent injunctions concerning\r\nInternet\r\ninfringements of this and similar works.  In RTC v. Lerma, Case No.\r\n95-1107-A, the court\r\nruled in favor of RTC, permanently enjoining the defendant infringer from\r\nposting on the\r\nInternet, the same OT III work that is the subject of this letter.  A jury\r\nin the United States\r\nDistrict Court in San Jose, California assessed damages in the amount of\r\n$75,000 against\r\na Mr. Henson for copyright infringement, for posting another of RTC's \"OT\"\r\nworks on\r\nthe Internet.  Mr. Henson was also permanently enjoined by the court against\r\nfurther\r\ninfringements. Three other United States courts have issued permanent\r\ninjunctions\r\nagainst Internet infringements of these and related works.\r\n     \r\n     I have a good faith belief and in fact, know for certain, that the\r\nposting of these\r\nworks through your system was not authorized by my client, any agent of my\r\nclient, or\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n     I declare under penalty of perjury that this information is accurate\r\nand that I am\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of RTC in this matter.\r\n\r\n     I appreciate your help and prompt attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nAva Paquette\r\nMoxon & Kobrin\r\n3055 Wilshire Boulevard\r\nSuite 900\r\nLos Angeles, California 90010\r\nTel: (213) 487-4468\r\nFax: (213) 487-5385","date_sent":"2005-04-19T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-04-19T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Moxon & Kobrin","principal_name":"Moxon & Kobrin (For the Religious Technology Center)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
