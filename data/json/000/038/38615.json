I am copying and pasting one of the emails (with header),  \r\nI have received by a member of CFAC in the additional comments box.\r\ncircumvention_what_product: This, Creating for a Cause (CFAC), group is  \r\nstealing money from donors. they claim they are taking donations for a  \r\ncharity called ~Embracing Kenya's Children~One Mission at a time~\r\nThat is not a true charity. I have tried to find it by googling it and by  \r\nasking them for a link on their facebook page.  \r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Creating-for-a-Cause/198085840237558\r\nLess than a minute after I posted the question it was taken off the wall.  \r\nBut I pressed my print screen button to capture my question. I have that  \r\nsaved. Also when a donor presses the \"buy now\" button you are redirected to  \r\na paypal account that is not in the name of CFAC or the \"charity\" they  \r\nare \"rasing\" money for. It is in the name of ACFC. ACFC is a paid members  \r\nwebsite owned by the blog owner/founder of CFAC  April Hunt.\r\nI have dealt with April Hunt many times. I belonged to her ACFC members  \r\ngroup but was kicked out when I disagreed with her. And she did not give me  \r\nmy money back until I threatened to take her to court. Her group CFAC has  \r\nhad other benefits to raise money that went into her account. I have  \r\ncontacted the FTC, the BBB,FBI, Yahoo, their ISP provider, the canadian  \r\nanti-fraud center (April hunt lives in Alberta, canada). And few more  \r\nplaces. There are quite a few of us who want her stopped. She is stealing  \r\nthe money of hard working people. On her cfac blog she states that they are  \r\nnot a charity so no one can get a receipt for their donation. That is not  \r\ntrue. If they are asking you to donate money for a 'cause' they are a  \r\ncharity and they have to register with the Canadian and US government.  And  \r\nCFAC states  \"Please do not request to see any of the administration's  \r\npersonal banking information.\" That is against the law! If someone makes a  \r\ndonation they have the right to ask for bank statements so they can see  \r\nwhere there money is going.\r\nCFAC offers no proof on their blog that a charity even exists. In an email  \r\nsent by one of the members of CFAC they state....\"We will be able to \"see\"  \r\nour donations at work with pictures from Kenya provided by a member of the  \r\nmission trip!!\" Pictures? I can get pictures online of children in Kenya.  \r\nThat is not proof! Like I said I have a lot of information I would love to  \r\nsend you if possible. I have April Hunts address and I.D's from yahoo.\r\nI am asking to please check them out before they have another \"benefit\" and  \r\nsteal more money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncircumvention_what_ways: Like I said above this does not have anything to  \r\ndo with circumvention or service. You do not have a scam or fraud button to  \r\npush so I had to push another button just to send you the information that  \r\nyou need!\r\ncompanyname:\r\ncountry_residence: US\r\nfull_name: Tena A Troy\r\nrepresented_copyright_holder_circumvention: Myself and others who are  \r\ntrying to put a stop to CFAC\r\nurl_box_circumvention_1: http://creating-for-a-cause.blogspot.com/\r\n","date_sent":"2011-12-29T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2011-12-29T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Complaint","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.
