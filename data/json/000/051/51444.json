{"dmca":{"id":51444,"type":"Dmca","title":"Not so HOT on sharing information regarding acronyms","body":"Hi Jeepmom,\r\n \r\nI wanted to touch base with you about a post on your blog.  I was directed to the blog this evening with regard to the acroynms link on your blog page.  With a few minor chages you made, it's pretty evident that the list was a direct copy and paste from Hotcouponworld.  I do see where you've removed abbreviations that would normally be used on a forum or posting environment like DH or MIL, but all the coupon ones are there, and in the same exact order and with the same exact language.  The compilation post from was posted at HCW on  02-21-2008, 08:28:00 AM.  \r\n \r\nI've highlighted just a few of the many similarities between the two, and find it ironic that even your examples in parenthesis would be an exact carbon copy.\r\n \r\nThere are two choices we can offer to resolve this issue with you.  You can either properly credit the site/author for the content, or you can remove it from your blog.  In the event of a failure to do either, we will file a formal DMCA (digital media copyright act) enforcement notification.\r\n \r\nPlease advise me of your choice no later than Friday, August 8th, 2008.  We wish you success with your blog.\r\n \r\nJulie Parrish\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nThe list from a compilation post at HCW found here http://www.hotcouponworld.com/forums/691723-post53.html\r\n \r\nAC -
