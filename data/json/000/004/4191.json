{"dmca":{"id":4191,"type":"Dmca","title":"Challenging Design","body":"Dear [private],\r\n\r\nIt has been brought to my attention that the cartoons you are reproducing at www.halfthedeck.com and perpetuating elsewhere on the Internet use a particular frame design that is nearly identical to the design I use on my own Snapshots cartoons (www.jasonlove.com).\r\n\r\nIn 1996, I registered this design with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The registration number is 2,065,162.  You may view this on my web site by clicking on \"Extras\" and then on \"Trademark Info\".  You may also look this up on the USPTO web site: www.uspto.gov/main/trademarks.htm.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect my legal rights, I must demand that you no longer use this particular frame design on your cartoons, and I must demand that you either remove or modify all of the cartoons on your web site that currently use this frame design.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know by January 31, 2005 that you have received this letter and that you have complied with my demands.  If I have not heard from you by that time, I will have no choice but to turn the matter over to my attorney.\r\n\r\n[private], I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJason Love\r\n\"Snapshots the Cartoon\"\r\n\r\nCertified Mail, Return Receipt Requested","date_sent":"2004-12-02T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-12-02T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Jason Love","recipient_name":"Aperio Technologies","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
