While the document\nit  \nshows is a semi-public document, it is normal practice to conceal those  \ndetails and only list the suburb and country.  It is therefore possible  \nthat they are misusing their access to that information, whether by  \naccident or intent.\n\nGoogle search further inadvertently violates my privacy by showing this  \npage as the first result when searching for my surname and suburb, with my\n \nfull address shown in the page extract. I believe that this could also  \nbreach Australian privacy laws, as the information is not intended to be  \n\nused in that way and such permission has not been granted (and is hereby  \n\nexpressly revoked). These are also search terms (ie name and suburb) that \n\nare likely to be used when trying to find information about a person,  \nmaking it reasonably likely that continued publication could lead to  \nnegative consequences.\n\nWhile it may be uncertain whether they can host the full document in their\n \njurisdiction, Google has a presence in Australia and so it certainly\nshould  \nnot be indexed in this way (with the private details shown on Google's  \nsearch result).\n\nI request that this page be removed from indexing.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://www.sumobrain.com/patents/wipo/Electrical-tagging-device/WO2009021273.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
