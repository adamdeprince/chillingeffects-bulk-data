Please note\r\nthat the Philips Business Unit CryptoTec (the Philips CryptoWorks\r\nConditional Access activities) has now been incorporated in the Irdeto\r\nEindhoven B.V. entity.\r\n\r\nIn searching the Internet, Irdeto Eindhoven B.V. has established that the\r\nwebsite\r\nhttp://www.digital-sat-board.gmc.to/wbb2/board.php?boardid=18&sid=10cd04f8ea\r\nafaa71a2a86dc3227bdb6c\r\n<http://.http://www.digital-sat-board.gmc.to/wbb2/board.php?boardid=18&sid=1\r\n0cd04f8eaafaa71a2a86dc3227bdb6c>\r\n(?the Website?) infringes its intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the\r\ncontent of the Website is unlawful, based on Clause 4 of the Conditional\r\nAccess Directive (98/84/EC).\r\n\r\nPlease provide me with the name and contact details of the owner of the\r\nWebsite. Reference is made to the ruling of the Dutch Supreme Court of\r\n25 November 2005 (Lycos/Pessers), in which the Supreme Court ruled that an\r\nISP should co-operate with third parties in retrieving the identity of the\r\noperator of a website if the content of such website could be unlawful\r\ntowards those third parties.* *\r\n\r\nI hereby request you to take sufficient action in order to remove the\r\nWebsite from the Internet. I emphasize that an ISP can be held liable for\r\ninfringing information on websites for which it is responsible.\r\nFurthermore, based on article 14 of the European Directive on Electronic\r\nCommerce (2000/31/EC) (implemented in the Netherlands in article 6:196C of\r\nthe Dutch Civil Code) and based on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act\r\n(article 512 US Copyright Act), an ISP is obliged to as soon as the ISP\r\nobtains actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and is aware of\r\nfacts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is\r\napparent, to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the\r\ninformation. Reference is made to the decision of the Court of Appeal of\r\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands, dated 7 November 2002 (XS4ALL/Deutsche Bahn).\r\n\r\nI hereby kindly request you to inform me within 3 days after the receipt of\r\nthis notice, whether or not you will act expeditiously to remove or to\r\ndisable access to the information and whether or not you will assist Irdeto\r\nEindhoven B.V. in retrieving the identity of the operator of the Website.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Irdeto*\r\n\r\nEsmeralda Booth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFEOkn3vK/XpJs6oyURAo0RAJ4nCgTXul4/dAABN2grGJ8giWS4fwCgk5oi\r\ncog1w0SvX+nIuu8jyrp7iHc=\r\n=0Z2L\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-04-10T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-10T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Irdeto Eindhoven B.V.","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
