Ms. Yi is the owner of rights of publicity and privacy in\r\nher name and image. \r\n\r\n        Notwithstanding Ms. Yi's rights, it has come to our attention\r\nthat your web site located at\r\n\"http://www.adultfanclubs.net/pseek/Adults_Only/Celebrities/Centerfolds/\r\nY/Yi,044_Natasha/,\" links unauthorized reproductions of Ms. Yi's image.\r\nThe distribution of these images, as well as the use of Ms. Yi's name in\r\nmetatags on your web site and/or your use of Ms. Yi's name to increase\r\ntraffic to your web site, violates Ms. Yi's rights of publicity and\r\nprivacy.  Further, based on the fact that some of the images on the\r\nabove-referenced web site appear to have been illegally copied from\r\ncopyrighted photographs, this web site may also infringe the rights of\r\nvarious copyright owners.\r\n\r\n        We hereby demand that you and all those who have acted in\r\nconcert with you immediately cease any copying, transmission, or other\r\nutilization of Ms. Yi's name and image, and that you delete from your\r\nsite or other sites operated by you all unauthorized depictions of Ms.\r\nYi.  Should you not immediately do so, Ms. Yi expressly reserves all of\r\nher rights to file a lawsuit against you to obtain both damages for all\r\npast acts of infringement and an injunction to prevent any future\r\ninfringement.\r\n\r\n        If we do not receive your written confirmation before the close\r\nof business on November 15, 2006, that you have complied with these\r\ndemands, we will advise Ms. Yi to take such action against you as she\r\nmay deem appropriate.\r\n\r\n        This letter is not a complete statement of Natasha Yi's rights\r\nin connection with this matter, and nothing contained herein constitutes\r\nan express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies or defenses of\r\nNatasha Yi in connection with this matter, all of which are expressly\r\nreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n/s/\r\nDavid K.
