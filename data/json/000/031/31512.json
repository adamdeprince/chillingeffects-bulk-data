These methods and techniques are not\r\nauthorized by Macrovision and are an infringement of Macrovision's\r\nproprietary intellectual property.  Further, http://www.macupdate/\r\n<http://www.clonedvd.net/>  additionally infringes upon Macrovision\r\nthrough the use of Macrovision's trademarks \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI, the undersigned, CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that I am the owner\r\nor an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner of certain\r\nintellectual property rights, said owner being named Macrovision\r\nCorporation (\"IP Owner\").  I have a good faith belief that the listings\r\nor materials listed herein are not authorized by the above IP Owner, its\r\nagent, or the law and therefore infringe the IP Owner's rights according\r\nto state, federal, or United States law.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFurther, Macrovision believes that these website pages directly violate\r\nThe Planet's own \"Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)\", specifically: \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompliance with Law - Customer shall not post, transmit, re-transmit or\r\nstore material on or through any of Services or Products which, in the\r\nsole judgment of the Company . . .

As host of this\r\nwebsite, The Planet may also be liable if it does not take appropriate\r\naction.  Macrovision therefore demands that The Planet close or disable\r\naccess to the website until such time as it removes any products that\r\nbypass, hack, remove or otherwise circumvent Macrovision's digital\r\nrights management technology and copy protection technology.  If this\r\ncourse of actions is not executed timely and effectively, Macrovision\r\nwill have no choice but to resort to legal recourses to protect its\r\nrights. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease be aware that Macrovision takes any infringement (misuse) of our\r\nproprietary intellectual property most seriously and that it is our\r\npolicy to take all steps necessary to protect those rights.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease act immediately and confirm to me in writing that you have done\r\nso.
