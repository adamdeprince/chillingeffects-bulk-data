The trend is catching up fast as in 2005 wind energy generated less than one percent of global energy by producing 58,982MW of power. However, by 2008 eight percent of Europe\u2019s electricity was derived from wind, which was well ahead of coal and natural gas. Moreover, wind power generation in the United States has increased 13 fold from what it was in 2000, and this surge has played a crucial role in propelling the U.S. to the number one position in terms of wind energy production.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://infonet.thatbest.com/2010/12/22/what%E2%80%99s-next-in-wind-energy-harvesting-systems/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.ecofriend.com/entry/what-s-next-in-wind-energy-harvesting-systems/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
