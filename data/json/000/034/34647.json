I found\r\nthat the website is hosted in your server. I'd request you delete the\r\nhosting account for the website due to the nature of the business the\r\nwebsite is doing.\r\n~ The violation is not just a single event. I found that all the content on\r\np2preactor.com <http://p2preactor.com> is copied from other news sites in\r\nverbatim.\r\n~ I suggest that you delete the web site immediately to avoid your\r\ninvolvement into any legal trouble.\r\n~ Thank you for your attention.\r\n~ Regards,\r\n~  John Roberts\r\nfoodconsumer.org <http://foodconsumer.org>\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCrhMTvK/XpJs6oyURAu8jAJ9cP7sjNoW+uhhyCGn1d5Sn+K0nmwCgn7hL\r\nbC5czOyjPx7G9hJPOUQHWOY=\r\n=n3Y6\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-05-13T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-13T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"foodconsumer.org","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
