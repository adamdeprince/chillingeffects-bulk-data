It has come to my attention that one   \r\nof the sites \r\nyou are hosting has violated my copyrights. The offending party has   \r\ncompletely \"scraped\" \r\nthe design from my site which is in clear violation of the Digital   \r\nMillennium Copyright Act (DMCA). \r\nI reported this to their last host and they evidently moved to   \r\nhosting with The Planet. The user\r\nhasn't even bothered to removed the footer. \r\n \r\nThe site in question is: http://piratebayagency.com/ \r\n \r\nI have contacted the site owner and have yet to hear back. I would   \r\nask for your assistance\r\nin having this design removed ASAP. \r\n \r\nThank you for your time. If you should have any questions, please do   \r\nnot hesitate to contact\r\nme at 516-783-3710. \r\n \r\nThanks! \r\nRegards,\r\nChristopher \r\n \r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nChristopher Meinck\r\nchris@everythingtreo.com\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nEverything Treo | A Palm Treo Resource\r\nhttp://www.everythingtreo.com \r\n \r\nEverything Treo Store | Largest selection of Treo Smartphones &   \r\nAccessories\r\nhttp://store.everythingtreo.com \r\n \r\nEverything Q | A Motorola Q Resource\r\nhttp://www.everythingQ.com \r\n \r\nEverything iPhone | The site for iPhone. \r\nhttp://www.everythingiphone.com \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-01-30T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-30T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Smart Phone Resource, Inc","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
