A search for the\r\ndomain name in any search engine even pulls up piracy-related information.\r\nUltimately, we had recently reported to another hosting company\r\n(layeredtech.com) that our own companies' products were being illegally\r\ndistributed on this domain owner's other site, www.realestniggas.com, which\r\nwas successfully removed today (the entire site was geared towards\r\ndeliverying illegal downloads).  However, the www.hhkingz.com domain still\r\nexists and is being used intermittently for posting our companies' products\r\namong others (including mp3's and other pirated software/media).  See below\r\nfor the whois info:\r\n\r\nDomain name: HHKINGZ.COM\r\n\r\nRegistrant Contact:\r\n   [None]\r\n   Realest Niggas (Porky2k4@Hotmail.com)\r\n   +1.2818290161\r\n   Fax: none\r\n   21311 Branford Hils Lane\r\n   Katy, TX 77450\r\n   US\r\n\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\n   [None]\r\n   Realest Niggas (Porky2k4@Hotmail.com)\r\n   +1.2818290161\r\n   Fax: none\r\n   21311 Branford Hils Lane\r\n   Katy, TX 77450\r\n   US\r\n\r\nTechnical Contact:\r\n   [None]\r\n   Realest Niggas (Porky2k4@Hotmail.com)\r\n   +1.2818290161\r\n   Fax: none\r\n   21311 Branford Hils Lane\r\n   Katy, TX 77450\r\n   US\r\n\r\nBilling Contact:\r\n   [None]\r\n   Realest Niggas (Porky2k4@Hotmail.com)\r\n   +1.2818290161\r\n   Fax: none\r\n   21311 Branford Hils Lane\r\n   Katy, TX 77450\r\n   US\r\n\r\nStatus: Locked\r\n\r\nName Servers:\r\n   ns1.eniki.net\r\n   ns2.eniki.net\r\n\r\n\r\n   Name Server[whois+dns with ip] NS1.ENIKI.NET 69.93.205.163\r\n   Name Server[whois+dns with ip] NS2.ENIKI.NET 69.93.205.164\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, the hhkings domain does not appear to have anything uploaded to\r\nit's viewable parent directory at www.hhkingz.com, but seeing that it is\r\nstill used frequently as a referral URL for obtaining illegal material, it\r\nmust be disconnected.  We are trying to prevent the domain owner from\r\ncontinuing to post copyrighted material as well as being allowed to breach\r\nFederal law, our terms and conditions, and your own hosting company's\r\npolicy.  Can you see to it that past records of upload logs are analyzed for\r\npirated material?\r\n\r\nPlease let us know what is being done about the domain.  In the meantime, we\r\nwill be monitoring the domain for any more uploads.\r\n\r\n- --------------------------------------\r\nKindest Personal Regards,\r\nJonathan Lawrence\r\nModern Beats, Inc.\r\n\r\nModernBeats.com\r\nMPCsounds.com\r\nBuyaBeat.com\r\n\r\n512-255-5999\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCCl4XvK/XpJs6oyURAn7ZAKCH0FF19o6FuvGtJiv2G492sM/wfACfTWsW\r\ne2wkDpaiuFgJKbu7hbsjL/w=\r\n=+jPV\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2005-02-09T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-09T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Modern Beats, Inc.","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
