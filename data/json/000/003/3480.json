It is my belief that this duplication of my content has resulted in a penalty by Google. I have followed the template you provided and include the details as follows:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe copyrighted work at issue is the text, graphic creatives, application code (.php and/or .asp files), contracts, etc... contained at the website www.200cash.com.\r\n\r\n2.\tOur site has been wholly copied and submitted to your search engine as original work, in violation of our copyright, as www.500-cash.us.\r\n\r\n3.\tI can be contacted by email at [private]@[private].com, or by phone: xxx-xxx-xxxx\r\n\r\n4.\tThe whois information on 500-cash.us is attached on pages 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n5.\tI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing webpages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\n6.\tI swear, under penalty of perjury consistent with United States Code Title 17, Section 512, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen upon inspection of the infringing site that there has been blatant, wholesale duplication of our site. Many (but not all!) of the references to 200cash.com have been replaced by 500-cash.us. I believe that the similarity in names was selected to intentionally deceive the search engines into believing this was a duplicate site as we had enjoyed strong place under our highest volume keyword phrase \"payday loans\".\r\n\r\nTheir addition of Google Adsense Ads, I believe, is also an attempt to win your favor of stolen site over ours in a debate.\r\n\r\nFinally, it can be shown that literally none of the link partners on our site link to this copied site.\r\n\r\nI eagerly await confirmation of your actions in this matter, and a restoration of our site back to good standing. It has always been our policy to follow Google's Terms of Service rigorously and have enjoyed good results in the organic listing for quite some time. It is EXTREMELY frustrating to see this kind of feeble attempt to copy our success result in having us eliminated. (Unless of course this actually was their plan!)\r\n\r\nThanks again for your consideration.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n[private]\r\n200CASH.COM, INC\r\n\r\n[private]@[private].com\r\n\r\nPhone: xxx-xxx-xxxx","date_sent":"2004-06-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-06-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"200cash.com","recipient_name":"Google, Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
