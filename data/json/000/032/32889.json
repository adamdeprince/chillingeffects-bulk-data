Work  \ninstructions tend to be more detailed than procedures. Procedures can take  \nthe form of a narrative, a flow chart, a process map, or any other suitable  \nform. Work instructions can also take any suitable form. However, one of  \nthe best ways to document a work instruction is to use a form.
