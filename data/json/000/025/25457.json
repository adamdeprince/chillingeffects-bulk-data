These publications have no license support documentation \r\n> from the design owning company and general website content confirms \r\n> malicious intent against our company. \r\n> The exact placement of infringement is: \r\n>\r\nhttp://www.allfreetemplates.org/monster-templates-tm-oscommerce-template\r\n> s/  \r\n>  \r\n> These threads contain recompiled sources which were ripped from the \r\n> original pre-view pages at http://TemplateMonster.com website. All of\r\n> the stolen \r\n> source numbers (they usually start the topic from words TM) correspond\r\n> to the official products numeration. \r\n> We direct your attention to the fact of massive publications that \r\n> violate the copyrights of all major web design vendors such as\r\nboxedArt \r\n> and DesignLoad. \r\n>  \r\n> Because of the obvious Templatemonster products distribution, \r\n> we direct your attention to the terms of our company's License \r\n> Agreement (http://www.templatemonster.com/terms.php) which clearly \r\n> prohibits the reselling of our products by any potential or current\r\n> customer. \r\n>  \r\n> Our website clearly states \"Website pages content copyright - \r\n> 2002-2005 Artvertex, Inc.\" The permission of  information \r\n> publishing actions from your server is illegal.
