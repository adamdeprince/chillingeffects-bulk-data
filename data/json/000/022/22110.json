We sub-contracted a SEO company out of San Antonio, TX \"webmarketing champs\" to make upgrades, add pages and seo works. Much to our surprise they were scamers, very poor seo and almost all of the upgrades were taken from other sources. Since this has happen, they \"webmarketing champs\" have went out of business. At that time we  hired another source which has upgraded and changed any and all infringements that may have accurded. We were contact about your posting on Chilling effects thru our present SEO company just as of lately. We write this letter letting you know we have taken all measures to make sure we have no issues and are still willing to make changes if necessary.
