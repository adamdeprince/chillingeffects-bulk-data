They keep trying to paraphrase, so I can't find them in Google searches, but I subscribe to CopySentry and also Google my own material in case something escapes CopySentry.\r\n\r\nThis time, see: http://magicediting.com/younq.html \r\nCompare with www.book-editing.com\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Identify in sufficient detail the copyrighted work that you believe has been infringed.\r\n\r\nThe copyrighted material appears in Google searches. I search for fragments from my copyrighted pages and often come up with one of their pages. They have switched hosting companies and put my material back up. Their hosting company cannot be contacted.\r\n\r\n2. Identify the material that you claim is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #1 above.\r\n\r\nFor example see, on their site:\r\nWe welcome authors of all experience levels!\r\nYou are probably aware of what you are up against. Publishing houses receive hundreds of manuscript submissions each day. The eyes of the publishing house in-house editors are trained to weed out the sloppy. If you're an unpublished writer, you must be meticulously polished and presentable to even get your submission read.\r\n\r\nYou will want the publisher to be captivated and impressed by your writing, not dismayed by mistakes. You may have a terrific story, and even have the talent to tell it, but your errors will stand out to the trained eye of the publishing professional.\r\nA manuscript should be noticed for its content and quality. Having the wrong words, unclear thinking, convoluted sentence structure, unrealistic dialogue, and temporal inconsistency, is not the way to get your work recognized.\r\n\r\nYou may be a great writer, and even have a prolific imagination, but without proper editing, any publisher will spot the errors in your submitted work right away. This fact makes the editing process as essential to having your book or work published as the writing process is.\r\n\r\nVery seldom will a writer be a good choice as an editor for his/her own work and even a great writer needs an editing perspective other than himself/herself. When proofreading ones own work, one tends to overlook mistakes. Your mind fills in what it thinks should be there. Sometimes the writer is too close to the material to notice even the most blatant errors. A professional book editor can recognize the repetitions, faulty logic, inconsistencies, and other problems that are often overlooked by the writer.\r\n\r\nEditing is just another step in the writing process. Don't let your book or manuscript be sent out without this important step. No job is too big or too small, our rates are very reasonable, and your date requests are honored. And because your satisfaction is our main goal, we also welcome your questions at any point in the process.\r\n\r\nAND FROM WWW.BOOK-EDITING.COM\r\nYou've probably heard what you're up against. Publishing houses receive hundreds of submissions each day. The eyes of an in-house editor are trained to crush the weak and champion the strong. If you're an unpublished writer, you must be meticulously polished and presentable to even get your foot in the door.\r\n\r\nYou want the publisher to be captivated by your writing, not assaulted by a litany of mistakes. You may have a terrific story, and even have the talent to tell it, but it's your errors that will stand out to the publishing professional.\r\n\r\nLiterary agents are not book editors, but they appraise your submission with a critical eye and will not submit to any publisher a manuscript that isn't ready. An ethical literary agent will, instead, return it to you and suggest you retain a professional book editor.\r\n\r\nMany manuscripts need more than error correction. Substantive editing of a fiction manuscript includes structural and organizational editing with regard to character development, plot, exposition, dialogue, and other critical literary elements. Nonfiction books may also need additional levels of reorganization or rewriting for clarity and logical flow, along with other important aspects beyond simple copyediting.\r\nA manuscript should be noticed for its content and quality. Being noticed for wrong word choices, fuzzy thinking, convoluted sentence structure, stiff and unrealistic dialogue, and point of view flip-flops is not the way to win friends and influence people.\r\nIn short, the final part of the writing process is having a professional book editor and proofreader (not your neighbors or your kid's English teacher) polish the manuscript before it's offered to an agent or publisher.\r\n\r\nNo editor can guarantee publication, but if you want your work to have the best chance of being read and considered seriously--and if you are open to other opinions about your work--we'll be glad to help you work toward that goal.\r\nProvide information reasonably sufficient to permit Google to contact you (email address is preferred).\r\n\r\n[Private] [private]@comcast.net \r\n[phone]\r\n\r\nProvide information, if possible, sufficient to permit Google to notify the owner/administrator of the web page that allegedly contains infringing material (email address is preferred).\r\nRegistrar whois lookup (whois.godaddy.com) Registrant:\r\nMagicGraphix.com\r\n[private]\r\nWest Fork, Arkansas 72774\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nRegistered through: GoDaddy.com \r\nDomain Name: MAGICEDITING.COM \r\nCreated on: 13-Jul-03\r\nExpires on: 13-Jul-06\r\nLast Updated on: 13-Jun-05\r\n\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\n[Private] [private]@magicgraphix.com MagicGraphix.com\r\n[private]\r\nWest Fork, Arkansas 72774\r\nUnited States\r\n[private] Fax -&#8209;\r\nTechnical Contact:\r\n[Private] [private]@magicgraphix.com\r\nMagicGraphix.com\r\n[private]\r\nWest Fork, Arkansas 72774 United States\r\n[private] Fax -&#8209;\r\n\r\nDomain servers in listed order \r\nNS1.UNLIMIHOST.COM \r\nNS2.UNLIMIHOST.COM\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nI request that www.magiceditinq.com and other sites that you might find with my material, verbatim or paraphrased, be removed from the Google index.\r\n\r\n[Signature]\r\n[Private]\r\nwww.book-editing.com\r\nwww.manuscriptediting.com \r\nwww.writingnetwork.com","date_sent":"2005-06-14T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-14T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Book-Editing.com","recipient_name":"Google","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
