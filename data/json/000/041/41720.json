The machine makes use of the sun\u2019s rays and a metal oxide called ceria to break down carbon dioxide or water in fuels that can be stored and transported. Unlike solar panels, which work only during the day, this new machine is designed to store energy for later use","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://infonet.thatbest.com/2010/12/28/new-%E2%80%98plant-mimicking%E2%80%99-machine-generates-fuels-using-solar-energy/"},{"url":"http://pictureartswallpaper.blogspot.com/2010/12/new-technology-from-us-and-switzerland.html"},{"url":"http://sigalonenvironment.soup.io/since/97919088?mode=own"},{"url":"http://surflightroy.net/2010/12/"},{"url":"http://www.ecobar.net/2011/01/top-10-renewable-energy-technology-breakthroughs-in-2010/"},{"url":"http://www.futurenewsnetwork.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30056%3Anew-%E2%80%98plant-mimicking%E2%80%99-machine-generates-fuels-using-solar-energy&catid=89%3Aeco&lang=en"},{"url":"http://www.greencleaningideas.com/2010/12/new-%E2%80%98plant-mimicking%E2%80%99-machine-generates-fuels-using-solar-energy/"},{"url":"http://www.solarfeeds.com/solar-sphere/15495-new-plant-mimicking-machine-that-uses-solar-to-generate-fuels"},{"url":"http://www.transportandmobility.co.za/content/energy-resource/ejournal/item/903-top-10-renewable-energy-technology-breakthroughs-in-2010.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.ecofriend.com/entry/new-plant-mimicking-machine-generates-fuels-using-solar-energy/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
