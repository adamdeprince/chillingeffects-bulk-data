{"dmca":{"id":1830,"type":"Dmca","title":"Demand to Cease and Desist and Retract Libel","body":"Law Offices\r\n  Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough, LLP\r\n  999 Peachtree St, N.E.\r\n  Suite 1400\r\n  Atlanta, GA 30309\r\n  \r\n  August 18, 2003\r\n\r\n  Via Hand Delivery\r\n\r\n  Dear [Private]:\r\n\r\n     This law firm represents [Private], and we have been\r\nasked to write this letter to you. Many of your\r\nstatements about [Private] in your e-mail postings are\r\nuntrue and defamatory. You made them maliciously to\r\ninjure [Private]in its trade, office and profession. As\r\nsuch, they are defamatory per se. Under O.C.G.A.\r\n51-5-11, this letter constitutes a demand for\r\nimmediate retraction in writing of these false and\r\nlibelous statements. In accordance with O.C.G.A\r\n51-5-11(b)(1)(C), [Private] deamnds that your retraction\r\nand correction be accompanied by an editorial in which\r\nyou specifically repudiated your libelous statements.\r\n     \r\n     Your web psotings and conduct also constitute\r\ntortious interference with the business and\r\ncontractual relations of [Private]. As such, they are\r\nactionable and expose you to the imposition of\r\ncompensatory as well as punitive damages.\r\n\r\n     Below, we have noted some of the more patent,\r\nmalicious, and libelious comments made by you in your\r\ne-mails; some of them also evidence your tortious\r\ninterference. If [Private] is forced to file suit to stop\r\nyour wrongful conduct, it will also seek an award of\r\nits attorney fees and litigation expenses.\r\n\r\n(Note: Complaints were not numbered in the original\r\nletter-I have done so here so each can be easily\r\naddressed)\r\n  \r\n     1. In your postings, you repeatedly stated that\r\nyou have been \"contacted by the CEO of this company,\r\n[Private] [Private] is not the CEO of\r\nEufora.\r\n\r\n     2. In your psotings, you consistently and falsely\r\nstated the high limit of [Private's] credit builder\r\nprogram. It is $138.85, and not \"$59.95 with payments\r\nof $6.95\" as you state.\r\n\r\n     3. On the [Private] program high limit, you mistated\r\nthe facts. The high limit for the [Private] program is\r\n$219.85 and not as you have statedm \"$95.95 with\r\npayments of $10.00.\"\r\n\r\n     4. You incorrectly contecded that [Private] does not\r\nreport the high limit. This is patently false.\r\n   \r\n     5. [Private] does not claim to build credit in the\r\nsecond year, and your comments about credit building\r\nin the second year are false and malicious.\r\n\r\n     6. In one of your postings, you referenced an\r\narticle on [Private] and claim with no basis in fact\r\nthat it is similar to [Private's]program. The product\r\nreferenced in that article is not similar to [Private's]program.\r\n\r\n     7. In your postings you stated: \"It's been a\r\ncouple of days since I had communications with [Private] or his legal team.\" You have never had\r\ncommunications with [Private's] or [Private's] legal\r\nteam.\r\n   \r\n     8. In your posting of July 2, 2003, you\r\nproclaimed: \"No response from any of the credit\r\nbureaus. I guess it's BBB complaint time. Update\r\n07/03/03 BBB complaint filed against Trans Union..but\r\nEquifax is investigating the matter.\" YOur malicious\r\nattempt to interfere with [Private's] business and\r\ncontractual relations with Equifax has damaged [Private],\r\nfor which you are liable in damages.\r\n\r\n     9. In a web posting you stated: \"One thing is for\r\nsure [Private] cards were never 'backordered due to high\r\ndemand'. The bank told me the truth-the delay was\r\ncaused by printing problems...not high demand at all.\"\r\nYour contact with the bank constitutes tortious\r\ninterference in [Private's] relations and contract with\r\nthe bank. This delay was due to printing problems,\r\nwhich further delayed an already exisitng backorder\r\ndue to high demand. There is no basis in fact for your\r\nmalicous comments.\r\n\r\n     10. In another posting you stated: \"No wonder\r\nthey seem to be having problems building an affiliate\r\nnetwork.\" This is not true. [Private] has successfully\r\nbuilt an affilaite network.\r\n\r\n     11. In numerious postings you claimed that\r\n[Private's] credit card is not designed to build credit.\r\nIn fact, you knew at the time that you made these\r\nfalse and malicious statements that [Private's] prepaid\r\ncredit card does build credit. This is what makes it\r\nunique in the industry.\r\n\r\n  Many of these errors have been previously brought to\r\nyour attention. Also, on occasion you have admitted\r\nthat your postings exceeded the bounds of free speech.\r\nYour failure to correct your erroneous and false\r\nstatements and their repitition after notice of their\r\nfalsehood constitutes further publication of libel. It\r\nalso confirms your malicious intent.\r\n\r\n   If you do not immediately publish the requested\r\nretraction, and cease and desist from tortious\r\ninterference and making false and malicious comments\r\nabout [Private], it's officers, and its programs, wewill\r\nfile suit against you. Please govern yourself\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\n[Private]\r\n\r\n \r\n","date_sent":"2003-08-18T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-08-18T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":"Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough.
