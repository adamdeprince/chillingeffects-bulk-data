But recently, there\u2019s been quite some buzz about the latest high-profile foreclosures to hit the news: those homes that were given away for free through the Extreme Makeover Home Edition show.\r\n\r\nThe Extreme Makeover program makes for great reality tv by providing \u201cfree\u201d custom-built homes to families that have been hard on their luck in order to give these families a fresh start. But unfortunately, for a couple of these home recipients, their change of fortune doesn\u2019t stick and they promptly lose their homes to the banks. Here are some details of these cases, along with my thoughts:\r\n\r\nHow Big Houses Can End Up In Foreclosure\r\n\r\n#1 The Harpers\u2019 Story\r\n\r\nIn particular, this magnificent Extreme Makeover home owned by the Harper family is one such casualty of foreclosure borne of poor financial decisions.\r\nbig houses in foreclosure\r\n\r\nextreme makeover home edition house in foreclosure\r\n\r\nbig house, extreme makeover home edition\r\n\r\nFrom thestar.com:\r\n\r\n    In Clayton County, Georgia, more than 1,800 people showed up to help ABC\u2019s Extreme Makeover team demolish a family\u2019s decrepit home and replace it with a sparkling, four-bedroom mini-mansion in 2005. The finished product was a four-bedroom house with decorative rock walls and a three-car garage that towered over ranch and split-level homes in their Clayton County neighbourhood. The home\u2019s door opened into a lobby that featured four fireplaces, a solarium, a music room and a plush new office. \r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s more, the house cost $450,000 to build, with reports also stating that Beazer Homes raised an additional $250,000 for the Harpers, in order to cover scholarships for the family\u2019s kids and to help defray maintenance costs and property taxes for the home. It turns out that after such a tremendous bounty is showered upon grateful and lucky families such as the Harpers, these folks are sent along their merry way. They are on their own financially, after the show bestows upon them a gold mine that turns very quickly into a money pit.\r\n\r\n    ABC said in a statement that it advises each family to consult a financial planner after they get their new home. \u201cUltimately, financial matters are personal, and we work to respect the privacy of the families,\u201d the network said.\r\n\r\nHow could fortunes change so drastically in three years\u2019 time?\r\n\r\n#2 Jessica Boey\u2019s Story\r\n\r\nOne other Extreme Makeover home is lost to foreclosure due to a death in the family:\r\n\r\n    Ty Pennington and his team built Jessica Boey a new home to help her during her fight with cancer in October. Boey passed away in late December and now, the family is struggling to pay for the expensive new home.\r\n\r\n    There\u2019s still $250,000 dollars left on the old mortgage that they have to pay, plus they\u2019re paying property taxes for the value of the new home because it\u2019s worth more than the old home was. On top of that, utility bills now cost anywhere from $500 to $700 dollars a month.\r\n\r\nWas this something that could have (or should have) been prevented with adequate financial preparation?\r\n\r\nIn an earlier post I wrote about the Extreme Makeover Home Edition show, I stated that the idea behind the television program is wonderful, but I\u2019ve expressed my skepticism over its whole premise, and wondered whether the show\u2019s participants are really prepared to own and maintain such elaborate homes (or mansions). Were these people ready to receive such generous gifts? I\u2019m sure many are, but this doesn\u2019t alter the fact that those who experience a sudden change in fortune often find themselves in a vulnerable situation: when you\u2019re steeped in financial difficulty and suddenly receive a massive windfall, you\u2019re susceptible to financial stress. Without some solid financial guidance and direction (even intervention!), those in this quandary can eventually find themselves back to square one.\r\n\r\nStories like these just emphasize the importance of fostering money management skills in our homes and schools.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://niketalk.yuku.com/topic/173662/Extreme-Makeover-doesn-t-pay--pay---houses--build-vol-read--fine-print#.Th9GnOAuOqk"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.thedigeratilife.com/blog/index.php/2008/08/08/mortgage-payments-home-ownership-costs/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
