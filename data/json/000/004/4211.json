{"dmca":{"id":4211,"type":"Dmca","title":"Negotiating Acceptable Use of Domain Name","body":"Dear [Private], \r\n\r\nWe are in receipt of the letter you sent earlier this year to [Private].  Mr. [Private] has kindly passed your response back to me as Intel takes the protection of its trademark rights very seriously.  \r\n\r\nWhile we understand your concerns (that you feel Intel is unjustly pursuing your use of the PROINTELL name), I can assure you that we have taken all the appropriate steps before determining that your use of PROINTELL was a use we must pursue in order to fully protect the famous INTEL mark.  We are in fact obligated by law to protect our mark, otherwise we risk losing our trademark rights in the INTEL mark, which as of this year is worth over 31 billion to Intel.  \r\n\r\nI would certainly be willing to discuss the reasons we are concerned about your use of this name, and would therefore like to set up a telephone call for this purpose.  If there is a good time for me to call tomorrow or early next week, please let me know.  I have from your letter the phone number [Private] ","date_sent":"2004-12-09T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-12-09T05:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Intel Corporation","recipient_name":"PROgressive INTELLigence","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
