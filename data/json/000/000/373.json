{"dmca":{"id":373,"type":"Dmca","title":"Starbucks Coffee Company","body":"Dear [Recipient]:\r\n\r\nThis firm represents Starbucks Corporation dba Starbucks Coffee Company and its subsidiaries (collectively \"Starbucks\"). We have been asked to contact you with respect to your Web site, backwash.com, which Starbucks has discovered is \"framing\" the genuine starbucks.com Web site. This letter serves to request that you terminate this activity, which violates Starbucks copyright and trademark rights.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that backwash.com is engaged in the process commonly referred to as \"framing\" the starbucks.com Web site. Specifically, backwash.com is reproducing the copyrighted content of the Starbucks site, and displaying that content within borders that are created and maintained by backwash.com. These borders not only create the false impression that there is some relation between your business and Starbucks, but the close proximity of Backwash banner advertisements and the Starbucks trademarks threatens to weaken the public's association between the Starbucks marks and the products they identify. \r\n\r\nThe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently held that Internet framing constitutes copyright infringement in violation of federal law. See Kelly v Arriba Soft Corp., 280 F.3d 934 (9th Cir. 2002). In addition, Starbucks believes that the framing of the starbucks.com site violates its rights under trademark and related laws, constituting, among other things, trademark infringement and violation of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act, 15 U.S.C.
