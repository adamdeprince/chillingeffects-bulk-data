{"dmca":{"id":162,"type":"Dmca","title":"The Curio and Relic Weapons Gallery Takedown Notice","body":"Sirs-\r\n    I am the owner and author of the web site \"The Curio and Relic Weapons Gallery\". I am capable of tracing all web traffic that uses my pictures of weapons. Persons participating on your web site are copying the photo images that I created from my own gun collection to animate and skin and  make their own. There are many, many references via \"threads\" to the pictures on my web site. I specifically state on all major pages of my site- \"No reproduction without permission\". This is being ignored. Links to my web site I don't mind, however downloading and/or using my creations for personal gain, whether it be monetary, gaming purposes, or entertainment will not be allowed. I am hereby notifying you that any unauthorized use of the images is denied. I am requesting that you post a permanent message in your \"Animations and Skins\" section  asking participants to heed my message, and respect my work and advise those so inclined to contact me before using my images. I will continue to monitor activity from \"Day of Defeat\".\r\n\r\n    This first message's purpose is to let you know I am not happy that my images are being ripped off, and to document same. I will pursue and  exercise any option necessary to correct the situation.\r\n\r\nWebmaster,\r\nThe Curio and Relic Weapons Gallery\r\n","date_sent":"2002-01-24T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-01-24T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"The Curio and Relic Weapons Gallery","recipient_name":"Day of Defeat Development Team","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
