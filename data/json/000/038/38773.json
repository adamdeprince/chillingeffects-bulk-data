Unfortunately, they have replaced the\r\nprevious images with additional Getty Images' photographs that they have\r\nnot purchased.  I have attached a new DMCA takedown notice to this\r\ne-mail for the new images.\r\n\r\nWe would like to be able to speak to the client about these\r\ninfringements, but we have had a difficult time getting in touch with a\r\nresponsible party there.  Would you be able to put me in touch with\r\nsomeone from this company?\r\n\r\nWith Best Wishes, \r\n\r\n\r\nKate Gardner\r\nCopyright Compliance Specialist\r\nGetty Images, Inc. \r\n601 N. 34th St.\r\nSeattle, WA 98103\r\nPhone: 206-925-6732\r\nFax: 206-925-5623\r\nKatherine.Gardner@gettyimages.com\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: dmca@theplanet.com [mailto:dmca@theplanet.com]\r\nSent: Friday, November 10, 2006 9:40 AM\r\nTo: Katherine Gardner\r\nSubject: Abuse complaint regarding the server located at [67.15.191.30]\r\nCase Number: 10202\r\n\r\nYour Reference Number: \r\nOur Case Number: 10202\r\n\r\n\r\n, , . \r\n\r\nSir, \r\n\r\nWe feel that the user in question in this violation has successfully\r\nremoved the material in question regarding the abuse complaint and have\r\nclosed the case in our records, as of 11/10/2006 11:40:02 AM. \r\n\r\nThe offending URL(S) was:  www.chicagocapitalfund.com \r\n \r\nInfringement(s) of Getty Images' photograph(s) (the \"Photograph\")\r\nhas/have been detected on the Web site  www.chicagocapitalfund.com  .\r\nThe infringing photograph appears on the Web site as follows: on their\r\nWelcome, About Us, Funds & Performance, Contact Us, and Calculator\r\npages.
