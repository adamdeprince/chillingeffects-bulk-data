The specific site in question is\r\nhttp://www.contentconcepts.net/. This copyright violation came to my\r\nattention when I crosschecked my page http://\r\nwww.editorsforstudents.com/editing.html on http://www.copyscape.com.\r\nArchive.org will show that the plagiarized copy originally appeared on my\r\npage. In all likelihood, judging from my past experience, plagiarized copy\r\nappears on other pages on this site.\r\n\r\nContentconcepts.net's flagrant plagraisim creates the impression that copy\r\nappearing on my site may itself have been plagiarized, and therefore\r\nundermines the originality and veracity of editorsforstudents.com. As a\r\nresult, I'm forced to write to request, pursuant to the recommendations of\r\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that you take further action,\r\nincluding, if necessary, removing Contentconcepts.net from it's current home\r\non the Internet until their site is revised to comply with copyright law.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJames Brown\r\nEditorsForStudents.com","date_sent":"2006-03-24T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-03-24T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"James Brown","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
