Amphitheatre Pkwy\r\nMountain View, CA 94043 \r\n\r\nDear Sirs:\r\n\r\nThe blog secretstoebay.blogspot.com contains much of the content from my website word for word. There is no question that this is my content my website is given as the source on two of the five posts, and a link to my site is given on all five posts. My web pages are also listed on web.archive.org back to April 2000, and are registered with the US. Copyright Office.\r\n\r\nSince each of the posts does have a link to my site, I am not totally opposed to them remaining on secretstoebay.blogspot. But I do ask that these posts either be removed or only left as short descriptions with links IF AND ONLY IF this amount of duplication will hurt the standings of my own site in your search engine listings.\r\n\r\nThe posts in question are listed below including the url from lacetoleather.com containing the copyrighted text and the url from secretstoebay.blogspot.com with the date, title, post author, and post time. The listings are separated by url and date. \r\n\r\nAll of the web pages of mine that were copied can also be found indexed on\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/ebaucsecforb.html.\r\n\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/whenisbestim.html\r\nhttp://secretstoebay.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_secretstoebay_archive_html \r\nTuesday, July 04, 200& \r\nBest time to List Items \r\nposted by Michael Hepden @ 11:54 AM \r\nSource: Rainbow Ridens Trading Post\r\n\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/winebay.html\r\nhttp://secretstoebay.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_secretstoebay_archive_html\r\nMonday, January 23, 2006 \r\nHow To Bid To Be Sure That You Win The Auction on eBay \r\nposted by Claire @ 10:26 AM \r\n\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/ebaysecrets.html\r\nhttp://secretstoebay.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_secretstoebay_archive_html \r\nMonday, January 23, 2006 \r\nThe Best Ways To Not Overpay For Items on eBay \r\nposted by: Claire @ 10:24 AM \r\n\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/whenisbestim.html\r\nhttp://secretstoebay.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_secretstoebay_archive_html \r\nFriday, January 20, 2006 \r\nWhen is the Best Time to List Your Items on eBay?\r\nposted by Claire @ 11:46 AM \r\n\r\nhttp://lacetoleather.com/earnmore.html\r\nhttp://secretstoebay.blogspot.com/2006_01_01_secretstoebay_archive_html \r\nFriday, June 23, 2008 \r\nHow To Get The Highest Price\r\nposted by Michael Hepden @ 11:32 AM \r\nSource: Ebay Auction Secrets\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. \r\nI swear under penalty of perjury that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. \r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n[signed]\r\nPatti Norton\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-09-21T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-09-21T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Patti Norton, Lace to Leather","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
