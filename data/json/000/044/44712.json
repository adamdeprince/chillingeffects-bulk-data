The\nIFPI is a trade association that represents over 1,400 major and independent\nrecord companies in the US and internationally who create, manufacture and\ndistribute sound recordings (the \u201cIFPI Represented Companies\u201d).\n\n\n\n*Under penalty of perjury, we submit that we are authorized to act on behalf\nof the IFPI Represented Companies in matters involving the infringement of\ntheir sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law\nrights on the Internet.*\n\n\n\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above web sites on your\nnetwork.  These sites are offering direct links to files containing sound\nrecordings for other users to download.
