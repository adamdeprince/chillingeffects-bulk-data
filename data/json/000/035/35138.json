Jigsaw Data Corporation has made no\r\neffort to \"substantially comply with the required notification elements\r\nof the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\")\" because the\r\nabuse at issue is not being reported with respect to any copyright\r\nclaims at this time.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor clarification, the jigsawdatacorporation.biz\r\n<http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/>  domain, which ThePlanet.com\r\nInternet Services, Inc. ('the Planet.com\") is hosting at 67.18.160.230,\r\nis falsely posing as Jigsaw Data Corporation, a Delaware corporation\r\nwith its principle offices in San Mateo, California.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThat imposter domain has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\r\nThe webpage found at www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz\r\n<http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/>  uses Jigsaw Data Corporation's\r\ntrademark (\"jigsaw\" Reg. No.\r\n<http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state=6urlqn.2.11> 3057241)\r\nand trade name repeatedly in the body of the page, and in its domain\r\nname, to deliberately create confusion between\r\nwww.jigsawdatacorporation.biz <http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/>\r\nand www.jigaw.com <http://www.jigaw.com/> . The domain name\r\nwww.jigsawdatacorporation.biz <http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/>\r\nis itself confusingly similar to Jigsaw Data Corporation's trademark.\r\nFurther the page is falsely stating a direct relationship between SMS\r\nMedia Pvt. Ltd, an Indian entity, and Jigsaw Data Corporation, a\r\nDelaware corporation, in an effort to defraud consumers in Indian and\r\nelsewhere and to intentionally cause damage to Jigsaw Data Corporation. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it appears that www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz\r\n<http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/> , hosted by the Planet.com, has\r\nbeen designed and may be used to illegally capture Jigaw.com user names\r\nand passwords (Phish) in an effort to facilitate unauthorized access to\r\nJigsaw.com, identity theft or to cause other damage.  Such conduct\r\npotentially violates a wide variety of state and federal statutes, as\r\nwell as a number of common laws, regardless of any potential copyright\r\ninfringement.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOur immediate intentions are follows: (i) to place the Planet on notice\r\nof this continuing fraudulent and illegal conduct; (ii) to give the\r\nPlanet an opportunity to avoid continued involvement with same by\r\nsuspending hosting of the reported domain pending its internal\r\ninvestigation; (iii) to mitigate potential damages to Jigsaw, our\r\nmembers, and unsuspecting consumers in India and elsewhere; (iv) to\r\npreserve evidence of any wrongdoing; and (v) to obtain appropriate\r\ninformation, within your procedures, or as may be acquired pursuant to\r\nlaw.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI respectfully request that your legal counsel, Ms. Andrea Almeida, with\r\nwhom I spoke yesterday, contact me immediately and that the Planet.com\r\ncease hosting the www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz\r\n<http://www.jigsawdatacorporation.biz/>  site pending resolution of this\r\nissue.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMark S.
