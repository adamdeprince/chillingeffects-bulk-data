{"dmca":{"id":13908,"type":"Dmca","title":"Buzzle.com abuzz over copying claims","body":"================================ = = = = = =\r\nProofs of http://www.isarticle.com scrapping from http://www.buzzle.com\r\n================================ = = = = = =\r\n \r\n\r\nisarticle.com has been copying articles from buzzle.com since last 2-3 months. Till now they have copied most of our articles, and our new articles consistently get added to their site. Out of 21 categories on isarticle.com, 18 categories are exact copy of ours. (Remaining 3 categories copy another site in a similar way our content is copied.)\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow are some proofs that http://www.isarticle.com is scrapping http://www.buzzle.com\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 1:\r\nOn August 7, 2006 we added HTML comments to our articles. The HTML comment contains pageview data in the following format:\r\n&lt;!--\r\nYour pageview was recorded by Buzzle.com as follows:\r\nURL accessed:\r\nHTTP_USER_AGENT: \r\nREMOTE_ADDR:\r\nREMOTE_HOST:\r\nHTTP_REFERER: \r\n--&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- Copyright Buzzle.com --&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nThese comments then started appearing in new articles on isarticle.com with the actual data, for e.g.:\r\n&lt;!--\r\n&lt;br /&gt;Your pageview was recorded by Buzzle.com as follows:\r\n&lt;br /&gt;URL accessed:\r\nwww.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104792.asp\r\n&lt;br /&gt;HTTP_USER_AGENT:\r\n&lt;br /&gt;REMOTE_ADDR: 205.209.163.26\r\n&lt;br /&gt;REMOTE_HOST: 205.209.163.26\r\n&lt;br /&gt;HTTP_REFERER:\r\n&lt;br /&gt;--&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&lt;br /&gt;&lt;!-- Copyright Buzzle.com --&gt;\r\n \r\n\r\nThis prooves that isarticle.com is using a crawler to get our content. Their crawler is run from 205.209.163.26 and shows empty User Agent.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe comments may not stay long on isarticle.com so we have taken snapshots of the article and viewsource. The attached snapshots were taken for following urls (in front of each isarticle url we have provided our url to verify that same content and comments do exist on Buzzle):\r\nViewSource01.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57445.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-4-2006-104524.asp\r\nViewSource02.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57446.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-4-2006-104522.asp\r\nViewSource03.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57447.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-4-2006-104521.asp\r\nViewSource04.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57452.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-6-2006-104676.asp\r\nViewSource05.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57256.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104859.asp\r\nViewSource06.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57354.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104739.asp\r\nViewSource07.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57228.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104792.asp\r\nViewSource08.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57285.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104780.asp\r\nViewSource09.jpg -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com/Article/57286.html -&gt;\r\nhttp://www.buzzle.com/editorials/8-7-2006-104804.asp\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 2:\r\nGoogle search for\r\nsite:www.isarticle.com buzzle \r\nreveals several references to buzzle.com.\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 3:\r\nOur paid authors have been sending disclaimers that they did not submit content on isarticle.com and are not sure how their articles are appearing on that site.\r\nFor e.g. Buzzle.com pays Sonal Panse ( http://www.buzzle.com/authors.asp?author=762) for writing articles to publish on buzzle.com. A Google search for site:www.isarticle.com sonal panse shows that all her articles on Buzzle.com are also on isarticle.com. Sonal quickly sent a disclaimer when she noticed this, that she did not provide the articles to isarticle.com.\r\n \r\n\r\nAbove is just one example. All our paid authors' articles have been copied by isarticle.com.\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 4:\r\n18 of isarticle.com's categories are named same as buzzle.com. The category name \"History & the Human Experience\" is typical of Buzzle.com for years. We do not claim copyright for category names, but this point is just to provide additional hints.\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 5 :\r\nAuthor names used in isarticle are exactly same as ours, while they show no author name for articles where we use \"Buzzle staff\" as author name.\r\n \r\n\r\nProof 6 :\r\nArticle meta description of isarticle.com is exactly same as that of buzzle.com. It is important to note that article descriptions displayed on isarticle.com pages are meta descriptions of our articles. That's why there may be slight difference between descriptions actually displayed on the article page by buzzle.com and isarticle.com.\r\n \r\n\r\n================================\r\nMore info on \r\nhttp://www.isarticle.com\r\n================================\r\nBelow info is just to provide additional hints to find the parent scraper network:\r\n \r\n\r\nisarticle.com had been displaying Adsense ads, but seems they removed the ads now. The ads can be seen if you do a Google search for\r\nallinurl:article -print site:isarticle.com\r\nand click on 'Cached'. Their ad code includes following line:\r\ngoogle_ad_client = \"pub-9058490403425989\";\r\n \r\n\r\nisarticle.com site seems to be hosted in China, but their crawler IP address is located in Fremont, CA. (This info is based on IP Lookup).\r\n \r\n\r\nDomain lookup for isarticle.com shows following info:\r\nCreation Date: 28-apr-2006\r\nExpiration Date: 28-apr-2007\r\n \r\n\r\nSo it is just over 3 months that the site came into existance, and the domain is registered for only 1 year. Page Rank of http://www.isarticle.com/ homepage is 5 as shown by Google Toolbar.\r\n\r\nSupporting screenshots have been sent to removals@google.com as they could not be included with the fax.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\"\r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[private]\r\nPresident\r\n\r\nCc: [private]@google.com\r\n\r\nBuzzle.com, Inc.
