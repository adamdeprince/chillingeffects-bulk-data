We have contacted him several times to remove the  \r\nsoftware , without success. Please contact him and have him remove our  \r\nscript / software from your server. \r\n \r\nWe have notified him via email that he has 48 hours to remove it (it is\r\nnow  \r\n42 hours), before we take legal action - this however, means the main\r\nserver  \r\nhosts (Ev1servers) would then be liable for hosting illegal software. We\r\n\r\nhope you can take care of this issue and have the software removed from\r\nyour  \r\nclients server. \r\n \r\nRegards, \r\nShivam \r\n \r\nSocketmail Team \r\n \r\n \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ----- Original Message -----  \r\n>> Dear Mr./Mrs. Khairul Ariffin, \r\n>> \r\n>> We regret to inform you we received a chargeback for the order placed\r\nby \r\n>> Laurence Rose for SocketMail Lite Edition on 01-MAY-2007. \r\n>> \r\n>> The customer had selected PayPal as the payment option for this\r\norder. \r\n>> \r\n>> Below you will find a copy of the original notification email. \r\n>> \r\n>> Sincerely, \r\n>> Your share-it! team \r\n>> ____________________________________________________ \r\n>> \r\n>> share-it! - a service of digital river \r\n>> http://www.shareit.de \r\n>> ____________________________________________________ \r\n>> \r\n>> \r\n>> Program                           = 154923 \r\n>> Number of licenses                = 1 \r\n>> ShareIt Ref #                     = 123219775 \r\n>> Reseller                          = \r\n>> Promotion name                    = \r\n>> \r\n>> Net sales                         = USD   -99.00 \r\n>> Net discount                      = USD     0.00 \r\n>> Sales tax/VAT collected for you   = USD   -18.81 \r\n>> Shipping charges                  = USD     0.00 \r\n>> Sales tax/VAT on shipping charges = USD     0.00 \r\n>> Our service fee                   = USD     2.96 \r\n>> Sales tax/VAT on service fee      = USD     0.00 \r\n>> Total amount                      = USD  -114.85 \r\n>> \r\n>> User data: \r\n>> Salutation          = \r\n>> Title               = \r\n>> Last Name           = Rose \r\n>> First Name          = Laurence \r\n>> Company             = \r\n>> Street              = Taliesin, The Street \r\n>> ZIP                 = ME14 4ER \r\n>> City                = Bearsted, Maidstone \r\n>> FullCity            = Bearsted, Maidstone, ME14 4ER \r\n>> Country             = United Kingdom \r\n>> State / Province    = \r\n>> Phone               = \r\n>> Fax                 = \r\n>> E-Mail              = riveracomplete@gmail.com \r\n>> VAT ID              = \r\n>> Payment             = PayPal \r\n>> Registration name   = Laurence Rose \r\n>> Language            = English \r\n>> Additional information: google \r\n>> The customer selected the following delivery type: e-mail. \r\n>> \r\n>> \r\n>> \r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-05-15T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-05-15T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Socketmail Team","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
