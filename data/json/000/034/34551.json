Besides the fact hes told me he was going to via AIM\r\nconversations I also have his ip address which i obtained by going\r\nthrough my server logs, which points to Australia, where he told me he\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nIf you look at http://www.myspacegeeks.com/tracker/\r\nand my site  www.viewaviewer.com\r\nyou will see a large similarity, I coded viewaviewer.com which has a php\r\nand sql backend, both which are identical to whats on his site, when\r\nputting in variables from my scripts, it functions as it would on my own\r\nsite, but on his, hes copied multiple files and put them on his site.\r\n\r\nIm looking to get his site shut down / suspended and even further legal\r\naction may be taken against him due to his accessing of my server\r\nwithout permsiion.\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\nOwner/Founder\r\nKris Chase\r\nwww.xgenerators.com\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-10-14T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-10-14T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"www.xgenerators.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
