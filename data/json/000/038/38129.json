The\r\nwebsite www.eminem-planet.com is currently hosting & displaying many copy\r\nwritten lyrics, photographs and other materials for the artist Eminem\r\nwithout permission. The lyrics for that are displayed are often very\r\nun-accurate and are displayed without permission. The record company has\r\ncontacted this and other sites Webmasters without a single reply. Since this\r\nsite is listed at many lyric sources as lyrics.com for Eminem lyrics, it?s\r\nstrongly recommended that these lyrics be taken down.  As for the\r\nphotographs and other materials, I personally know that these photographers\r\n& companies that own the copy write on the photographs will take action\r\nwithout notice as I have been a party to these actions in the past. To\r\nfurther add to the problem I strongly suggest you drop this client & site\r\nfrom your hosting company to avoid any future lawsuits and actions.\r\n\r\nI am a fellow site owner & hosting company and I thought you would like to\r\nknow of such abuse.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nJason Wagner\r\n\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCCTLevK/XpJs6oyURAjfvAJ99nHCc/awZzynWypA/kWlcR8uBWgCfSqxk\r\n410XDdKcVXyf8IyTQPOdWG4=\r\n=gwg7\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-02-14T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-14T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
