His name is Ashley Lawson.\nThis information is accurate for this one year (2008) and my father was a \n\nmember of the BNP coming up to the british elections.\nHe is no longer a member of the BNP and regrets his actions. This is  \ndefamation in my opinion as the information has not been taken down after \n\nthe year it was relevant to and the information on here is an obstruction \n\nto his privacy.\nMy father's details such as his address, mobile number and email address  \nare on here without his consent.\nThis has caused trouble for him locally to where he lives, I feel that I\ndo  \nnot need to provide the address as this site seems to have done so\nalready.\nI implore you to please remove this site even though it seems to be a  \nmirror as the high/large majority of people who's names are on this site  \nmost likely did not give consent for their details to be passed on in such\n \na public fashion.\nIf this information is not taken down I will be contacting my solicitor as\n \nthis company is the holder of the site. I have used this company's search \n\nengine for years as of yet and have recently signed up to it's e-mail  \nfacility. It is therefore that I will regretfully do this, but my father  \ndoes not need the hassle.\nThank you for the time reading this, if you wish to enquire further, my  \ne-mail address is above.\n\nLee Lawson\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://bnpmembershiplist-mirror.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/lat-to-lay.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
