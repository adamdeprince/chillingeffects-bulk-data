I have also mailed a signed Copyright Infringement\r\nnotice to your legal contact person. I have not received any reply to my\r\nemails or letter.\r\n\r\nGoogle and Yahoo have dropped this domain after reviewing my complaints\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nTravel-in-uk has copied hundreds (if not thousands) of pages from my site at\r\nwww.britainexpress.com and replaced my logo and put a few of their banner\r\nads on the copied pages.\r\n\r\nYour client is engaged in dishonest practice, and I'd like action taken.\r\nI hate to be a pain, but this really is unacceptable. I will be resending\r\nthis email as often as it takes until some action is taken.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDavid Ross\r\n\r\nPublisher\r\nBritain Express - The UK Travel and Heritage Guide\r\nhttp://www.britainexpress.com\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCyrJEvK/XpJs6oyURAuJAAJoCyozBRWTNc9AKWxXE6K2WT7JSQwCfdZdS\r\nCAAGgDdDgdstiAaXhC7mF5M=\r\n=7Ecu\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-07-05T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-07-05T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"www.britainexpress.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
