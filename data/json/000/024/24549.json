The IFPI is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies are some 1,500 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies\r\nin matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including\r\nenforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting infringing files on its network\r\n(see above referenced directory).  These files contain sound recordings by\r\nthe artists known as Star Academy.  These sound recordings are owned by one\r\nof our member companies and have not been authorized for this kind of use.\r\nWe have a good faith belief that the above-described activity is not\r\nauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  We assert that\r\nthe information in this notification is accurate, based upon the data\r\navailable to us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing files\r\nfrom your system or that you disable access to the infringing files.  In\r\naddition, please inform the site operator of the illegality of his or her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice. In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement.
