For\r\ninstance, in May 1998, a jury in the United States District Court in San\r\nJose, California awarded statutory damages in the amount of $75,000 against a\r\nMr. Henson for engaging in similar infringing activities on the Internet as\r\nto one single copyrighted work. Statutory attorneys' fees were also awarded\r\nagainst Mr. Henson and, in addition, he is also permanently enjoined from\r\ncommitting any further infringements.   A United States District Court in the\r\nstate of Virginia granted judgment for damages, costs, and a permanent injunction \r\nrelated to similar copyright infringement.  Permanent injunctions\r\nhave also been entered in three additional U.S. cases.\r\n\r\nSimilar results have been reached in Europe. On September 14, 1998, a\r\nSwedish court enjoined a defendant who engaged in similar infringements, in\r\naddition to finding that his actions in placing our client's copyrighted\r\nworks on the Internet violated the owner's rights under Swedish copyright\r\nlaw.  He was also fined for his illegal actions and ordered to pay litigation\r\ncosts.  The decision by the Swedish court was upheld on appeal in a decision\r\nissued on March 9, 2001. On June 9, 1999, a Dutch court found an individual\r\nand numerous Internet service providers had engaged in copyright infringement\r\nby posting, or hosting, our clients' copyrighted works on their web sites.\r\nThe court ruled that the service providers must remove such postings as soon\r\nas they are notified of them, subject to a monetary penalty for each day on\r\nwhich they do not comply\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we request that this copyrighted work be removed.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief, and in fact know for certain, that the posting of this work by your subscriber on his or her web page was not authorized by my client, any agent of my client, or the law.\r\n\r\nI declare under penalty of perjury that this information is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of RTC in this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[Attorney]\r\nMoxon & Kobrin\r\n[Private]\r\nLos Angeles, California 90010\r\nTel: \r\nFax: \r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2002-02-08T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-02-08T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":"Moxon & Kobrin","principal_name":"Religious Technology Center","recipient_name":"Holysmoke","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
