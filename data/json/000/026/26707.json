The program \"eazycart\" is a derived product of\r\n\"PHPCart\" \r\nfrom phpcart.net.  The copyright notices have been removed from the\r\nscripts \r\nand the documentation but you can easily check the validity of my claim\r\nthat \r\nthis is copyright material by reviewing the long history of my product \r\nPHPCart and the short history of \"eazycart\".   \r\n \r\nI respectfully request that you immediately cease providing any services\r\nto \r\nthe domain eazycart.com.  Failure to do so will require me to take legal\r\n\r\naction against you. \r\n \r\nIf you need any additional information or proof that the program\r\n\"eazycart\" \r\nis a copyright violation please let me know what you require.  I have\r\ncode \r\ndocumented in my forum from many years that are snippets of code from\r\nthe \r\ncopyrighted PHPCart program.  I also have full source code from the last\r\n3 \r\nyears of every release of PHPCart. \r\n \r\nPlease help me in this matter to prevent copyright infringement of my \r\nproduct. \r\n \r\nThank you, \r\nGeorge Hubert \r\nsales@phpcart.net \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-03-07T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-03-07T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"George Hubert","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
