Under Federal \r\nlaw, the University is required to immediately suspend Resnet service \r\nwhen it receives a DMCA notice.  There is a $100 administrative fee \r\nassociated with this suspension.\r\n\r\nYou must schedule a time to meet with Margaret Landsparger in the \r\nInformation Technology office, B8 EERC, between 1:00 and 3:00 to (1) \r\nDiscuss Copyright Policy at MTU (2) confirm that the infringing material \r\nhas been removed from your computer, and (3) that you have read and \r\nunderstand the Michigan Tech Computer Use Policy, located at: \r\nhttp://www.cec.mtu.edu/cacsec/info/cup_approved.html. This meeting is \r\nmandatory and must be attended whether you remain on resnet or not, \r\nalong with a Ethical Decision making writing assignment conducted by the \r\nOffice of Student affairs.\r\n\r\nReply to this E-mail to schedule your appointment\r\n\r\nIf there is a second violation, there will be much more serious \r\nconsequences from Michigan Tech.  At a minimum, a student will be \r\ncharged with violation of the computer use policy, theft of intellectual \r\nproperty and failure to comply with an official request, AND may have \r\ntheir Resnet service suspended for an indefinite period of time. \r\n\r\nIt is important to respect the intellectual property of others as a \r\nmatter of personal ethics.   Moreover, there are serious consequences to \r\ncopyright violations, including substantial civil penalties, and the \r\npossibility of criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n-------- Original Message --------\r\nSubject:         Notice ID: 182-2457566 ESA Foreign Notice\r\nDate:         Mon, 22 Jan 2007 10:52:50 -0800\r\nFrom:         esa-no-reply@copyright-compliance.com\r\nReply-To:         esa-no-reply@copyright-compliance.com\r\nTo:         abuse@mtu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\nEntertainment Software Association\r\n575 7th Street, NW, Suite 300\r\nWashington, DC 20004 USA\r\n\r\nAttention:  Intellectual Property Enforcement\r\nTelephone:  202-223-2400\r\nE-mail:  esa@copyright-compliance.com\r\n\r\n14 Jan 2007 19:43:48 GMT\r\n\r\n\r\nISP: Michigan Technological University\r\nESA Reference Number: 182-2457566\r\n\r\nDear Michigan Technological University:\r\n\r\nThe Entertainment Software Association (ESA) is a U.S. trade association that\r\nrepresents the intellectual property interests of numerous companies that publish\r\ninteractive games for video game consoles, personal computers, handheld devices and\r\nthe Internet  in the United States and in other countries (collectively referred to\r\nas ESA members).
