I believe what you have described is more like deceitful manipulation. It is not hypnosis.It could also be called brainwashing. It is one of the top hypnosis fears.Hypnosis is a matter of allowing your conscious mind to relax. The reason you want to do this is because the conscious mind is the part of you that is constantly evaluating the information around you. It will critique that information and decide whether or not to accept it.This is why it is called the inner critic.When the conscious mind is relaxed, thoughts and ideas are more easily accepted into the subconscious mind.For hypnosis to work, there must be a feeling of trust in the process and with the hypnotist. The moment this trust is broken, the conscious mind wakes up and the whole process is broken.Your conscious mind will not allow unethical suggestions that go entirely against your morals and ethics to enter into your consciousness.Cults use brainwashing and manipulation to get what they want. The leaders use domination and force, often guilt inducing tactics designed to separate you from your own free will. (Though I am certainly not a cult expert.)Hypnosis is vastly different.Hypnosis is a matter of being led down a garden path by someone that you trust (or yourself when you practice self hypnosis) towards a predetermined destination or goal.Have you gotten your free How To Do Self Hypnosis report and audio yet?You may also want to listen to this free self hypnosis audio to learn more about how to get past hypnosis fears and how hypnosis works.Here is an incredible example of how you can use self hypnosis to improve your life when you put your mind to it.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hopehypnotherapy.com/hypnosis-tips/protection-from-hypnosis/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hypnosis-self-help.com/protection-from-hypnosis.html"}]},{"description":"Every time I post new content on my blog, it is copied to the infringing website and linked back to my own content which gives me spammy link for my own original content which was copied.

It acts as if it were true.\r\nHi! I\u2019m Sherri Frost\r\nSince 2005, I\u2019ve worked alongside my husband, D.J.

It\u2019s possible that you won\u2019t go into a deep trance the first time but you will find that the more you practice, the easier it becomes.When a young toddler is first beginning to walk, she stumbles and falls quite a few times. Soon it becomes easy and she is running across the room and climbing up the furniture.It is the same way with self hypnosis. If you set the stage for yourself by finding a quiet place where you will not be disturbed and combine that with some relaxing music you will find that it will be even easier.This particular music is wonderfully designed for deep relaxation which is just perfect for a deep trance stage during your self hypnosis.Make sure you get your free audio and tutorials if you haven\u2019t already.
