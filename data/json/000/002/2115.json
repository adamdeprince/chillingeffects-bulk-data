The posting of \r\n_Anthem_ on the internet is therefore a violation of copyright, if done \r\nwithout the permission of the Estate.  In accordance with Ayn Rand's \r\nexpress wishes before her death, we cannot grant any such permission.\r\n\r\nWe would like you to remove this work from your site immediately.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJenniffer Woodson\r\nEstate of Ayn Rand","date_sent":"2001-09-04T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2001-09-04T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Copyright and Fair Use"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Estate of Ayn Rand","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
