Symantec also holds the registered trademark\r\nin the U.S.\r\n> and other countries for its name, SYMANTEC(r).  Symantec's rights are \r\n> evidenced by, among other things, registrations of its trademarks and \r\n> copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the \r\n> United States Copyright Office.  Symantec also includes product \r\n> activation technology in its products to prevent access by \r\n> unauthorized parties to its copyrighted products, including without \r\n> limitation, product subscription updates, renewals and activations.\r\n> \r\n> Symantec has been notified that you provide Internet access for the IP\r\n\r\n> address listed below.
