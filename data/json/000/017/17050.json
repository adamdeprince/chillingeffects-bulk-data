This notice is to inform you that many more of Joan Green's copyrighted craft booklets appear in their entirety as illegally scanned images posted as downloadable, printable files on your hosted online group \"Dmommas PC Mess\" at:\r\nhttp://groups. google. coralgrouu/Dmommas-PC-Mess\r\nThese illegal copies of Joan Green's patterns have all been posted by the Group Owner and sole poster to this group, Peggy James, email address, dmommaisharespc@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThis is a clear violation of International Copyright Law, US Copyright Law (specifically found in United States Code Title 17) as well as a violation of Google's own Terms of Service. This group is also in violation of trademarks rights, unfair business practices, and constitutes unfair competition and as such, I request this group be shut down.\r\n\r\nThe entire purpose of this group is to distribute illegal copies of copyrighted craft patterns. The group is using Google services for illegal purposes and will continue to do so, willfully, unless they are shut down. Each day that this group continues to illegally distribute copyrighted materials, Joan Green's company is losing money.\r\n\r\nJoan Green is the exclusive owner of the copyrights to these following craft booklets and has not granted permission for anyone to post these publicly. On each of these postings, her company, Joan Green Designs, and her name, Joan Green, along with her copyright notice is clearly shown. The copyrighted works at issue are the posted scans of Joan Green's copyrighted booklets as follows:\r\n\r\n1.
