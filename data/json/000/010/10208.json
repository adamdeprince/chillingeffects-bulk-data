My name is Jim Salomon, and I own substantial rights in the Salomon/Hilton Video. This is a follow up to: the Paul S. Berra, Esq. of Lavely & Singer letter to you of March 16, 2004 (in numerous prior emails to you, I've already attached copies) as a result of which Google reportedly removed something like 23 URL's; the Joseph P_ Costa, Esq. of Costa, Abrams & Coate LLP letter to you of May 28, 2004 (in numerous prior emails to you, I've already attached signed copies) as a result of which Google reportedly removed something like 41 URL's; my letter to David C. Drummond, Miriam Rivera and you of November 15, 2005; and my letters to you of November 29, 2005, December 7, 2005, December 12, 2005, December 14, 2005, December 22, 2005, January 2, 2006, January 3, 2006, January 11, 2006, January 16, 2006, and January 29, 2006. Also in numerous prior emails to you, I've already attached copies of the signed court-stamped above-referenced\r\nUnited States District Court complaints [the latter of these two complaints was filed on December 8, 2005].\r\n \r\nAs you may recall, Costa, Abrams & Coate LLP are litigation counsel for my brother Rick Salomon. Pursuant to Google's copyright complaint procedure, this letter shall set forth a website(s) returned on a Google Search(es) which is infringing upon my rights, the rights of Rick Salomon, and the rights of other significant interests.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Sections 512 (c) (3) and 512 (d) (3) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.
