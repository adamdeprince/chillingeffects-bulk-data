A copy of the press release is attached.\r\n\r\nThis matter is identical to the issue we brought to your attention previously on or about March 31st, 2004 whereby the same party had, without our consent, posted a copy of a press release on various other web pages in order to direct traffic to his own web-site, referring to himself as ex-Franchisee.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to re-direct legitimate traffic through misuse of a copyright protected press release for clearly unauthorized purposes is, in our view, copyright infringement and the press release must be removed from all pages that are unauthorized. The press release has wrongfully been posted to the following web pages, each of which has been separately identified by search query and infringing web pages described below:\r\n\r\nSearch query: \"E-Tailors prepare for a Green Christmas\"\r\nInfringing web pages: http://www.qooqle.ca/search?as q=%22E","date_sent":"2005-09-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-09-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"WSI","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
