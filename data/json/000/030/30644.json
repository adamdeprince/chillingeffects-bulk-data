These domains were hosting stolen\r\nand hacked code and database content from our site and we are\r\ncontemplating pursuing legal actions. Do you have backed up copies of\r\nthe code and more importantly of the database as of yesterday for proof?\r\n\r\nYour assessment of the third domain is correct:\r\nhttp://www.myspacetuner.com\r\n\r\nThis domain, aside from exactly looking similar to our site, thus far\r\nhas refrained from including any copyrighted material. Nor do they\r\ndisplay any of our database data. Our investigation has revealed that\r\nthey hired someone to clone our site for them. We are, howerver,\r\nmonitoring them.\r\n\r\nYour assistance regarding this matter is highly appreciated.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nKamran Rahbaran\r\n\r\n--- Copyright <Copyright@theplanet.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n>  To Whom It May Concern:\r\n> \r\n> Please note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice does \r\n> not substantially comply with the required notification elements of \r\n> the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n> \r\n> Please note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of your \r\n> claim.\r\n> \r\n> Please visit our web site at\r\n> www.theplanet.com/index.html?p=copyright.\r\n>  \r\n> Legal Response Team\r\n> THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n> \r\n> -----Original Message-----\r\n> From: abuse@ev1.net [mailto:abuse@ev1.net] Posted At: Wednesday, \r\n> November 29, 2006 5:06 AM Posted To: Copyright\r\n> Conversation: [EV1-C1968604A] Stolen Website\r\n> Subject: [EV1-C1968604A] Stolen Website\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> ==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n> 1.
