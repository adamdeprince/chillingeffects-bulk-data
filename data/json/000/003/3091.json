Even more surprising, we discovered that Google also links to a mirror of the original www.swissgates.com website, \r\nwww.swiss-banks-online.com that contains the very same fake testimonials we wrote you about in December.\r\n\r\nIf you look on Google with the words: Swiss-banks-online\r\n\r\nGoogle directly links to the page: \r\nhttp://www.swiss-banks-online.com/accountl.html \r\nhttp://www.swiss-banks-online.com/account2.html\r\nhttp://www.swiss-banks-online.com\r\n\r\nThis website~ infringes our copyrighted work.
