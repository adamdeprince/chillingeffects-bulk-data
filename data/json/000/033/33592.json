Furthermore, the content of the Webpage is unlawful, based on amongst others\r\nClause 4 of the Conditional Access Directive (98/84/EC) and the corresponding\r\narticle of the EC Copyright Directive (2001/29/EC), which provides legal protection\r\nagainst the illegal circumvention of technological protection measures.  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nDescription of the abuse \r\nThe web page publishes advertisement for Card sharing software that offer illegal\r\naccess to Irdeto2 encrypted Channels through payable internet card sharing\r\nsubscriptions. \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nAbout Irdeto Access B.V. \r\nFor information on Irdeto Access B.V.'s conditional access technology please see\r\nwww.irdeto.com <blocked::http://www.irdeto.com/> . Please note that the conditional\r\naccess system is designed, developed, manufactured and licensed by Irdeto Access\r\nB.V. and the system is proprietary to Irdeto Access B.V. Furthermore, please note\r\nthat Irdeto Access B.V. is an active member of AEPOC (European Association for the\r\nProtection of Encrypted Works and Services). Please see www.aepoc.org\r\n<blocked::http://www.aepoc.org/>  in this regard.  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nRequest to take action \r\nI hereby request you to take sufficient action in order to remove the Website from\r\nthe Internet. I emphasize that an ISP can be held liable for infringing information\r\non websites for which it is responsible. Furthermore, based on article 14 of the\r\nEuropean Directive on Electronic Commerce (2000/31/EC) (implemented in the\r\nNetherlands in article 6:196C of the Dutch Civil Code) and based on the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act (article 512 US Copyright Act), an ISP is obliged to as\r\nsoon as the ISP obtains actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and is\r\naware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is\r\napparent, to act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.\r\nReference is made to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Amsterdam, the\r\nNetherlands, dated 7 November 2002 (XS4ALL/Deutsche Bahn).  \r\nPlease provide me with the name and contact details of the owner of the related\r\nWebsite. Reference is made to the ruling of the Dutch Supreme Court of 25 November\r\n2005 (Lycos/Pessers), in which the Supreme Court ruled that an ISP should co-operate\r\nwith third parties in retrieving the identity of the operator of a website if the\r\ncontent of Webpages on such website could be unlawful towards those third parties.  \r\nProof of copyright  \r\nIrdeto Access B.V. is the rightful owner of the copyright and in the Netherlands no\r\nregistration is required for obtaining a copyright. Under the Bern Convention it is\r\nprohibited to demand a copyright registration certificate when asked to act against\r\ncopyright infringement on the basis of a non US origined copyright. Furthermore,\r\nunder the Bern Convention, to which the US is a member, in the US any non US\r\noriginated copyright will be awarded the same level of protection as a US registered\r\ncopyright without any registration requirement. Therefore, Irdeto Access B.V. may\r\ndemand direct action against any copyright infringement without proof of its\r\ncopyright. Please note that there is no such copyright registration number or\r\ncertificate.  \r\n \r\nStatement of good faith belief and authorisation \r\nIrdeto Access B.V. has the good faith belief that use of the infringing smart card\r\nsharing is not authorized by the copyright owner, being Irdeto Access B.V., its\r\nagent or the law.  \r\nThis notification is drafted observing accuracy and on the basis that Irdeto Access\r\nB.V. is, as the owner of the relevant copyright, authorized to act against the\r\nconcerned copyright infringement. \r\n \r\nAttached you will find a Power of Attorney authorising the undersigned to act on\r\nbehalf of Irdeto Access B.V. as well as downloaded files from the infringing website\r\nand the related WhoIs information.  \r\nThis statement is drafted under penalty of perjury that the information contained\r\nherein is accurate. \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nI hereby kindly request you to inform me within 3 days after the receipt of this\r\nnotice, whether or not you will act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to\r\nthe information and whether or not you will assist Irdeto Access B.V. in retrieving\r\nthe identity of the operator of the Website.  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nWith kind regards, \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\n  \r\n \r\nNelleke de Krijger \r\nTel:  +31 (0)23.556.2206  \r\nFax: +31 (0)23.556.2581 \r\n \r\nIrdeto  \r\n \r\nTHE PROVEN EXPERT IN CONTENT SECURITY FOR ","date_sent":"2007-01-19T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-19T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Irdeto Access B.V.","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
