It is considered information for \"reverse \r\nengineering\" and contains proprietary formatted data for the software and is \r\nNOT public domain.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.10thsfg.net/php_files/invboard/index.php?showtopic=3785&st=0&#entry23\r\n\r\nI must ask that you remove the packet traces from that url, all the other \r\ncomments I don't care about, but like I mentioned the packet traces are \r\nagainst the EULA.  Aside from all that I really wished you would have \r\ncontacted me prior to freaking out on this issue.  We have a reason for \r\ncollecting the information that we do.\r\n\r\nAfter our initial discussions I assumed we had a working relationship to \r\nfoster a successful release and continued future releases of this software.  \r\nHowever it appears that you \"turn on a dime\" and well, that's your \r\nperogative, but I guess I'm dissapointed in your lack of support.  I \r\nwould've expected someone who endorsed the software so heavily to come to me \r\nto resolve issues you had with it, not just blast your horns.\r\n\r\nThank you for the support and please let me know when the packet snif logs \r\nhave been removed from your forums.\r\n\r\n[private], CTO\r\nNexus Software, Inc.\r\n[PRIVATE]@nexussw.com\r\n\r\nCC: legal department; clan@armyops.nexussw.com\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nThe new MSN 8: advanced junk mail protection and 2 months FREE*  \r\nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail","date_sent":"2003-07-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-07-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Reverse Engineering"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Nexus Software, Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
