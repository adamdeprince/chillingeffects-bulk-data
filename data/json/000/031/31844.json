(the\r\nCouncil), the umbrella organization for Better Business Bureaus throughout\r\nthe United States.  Part of my job involves monitoring the Internet for\r\nimpermissible uses of the Council's BBBONLINE RELIABILITY Logo.  It has come\r\nto my attention that ThePlanet.com Internet Services hosts the web site for\r\nan Internet site called Get Wet International in Pismo Beach, CA.  On this\r\ncompany's web site located at www.getwet.com, the BBBONLINE RELIABILITY Logo\r\nis displayed without our permission.\r\n\r\nThe Santa Barbara, CA BBB and the Council have contacted the owner of the\r\nsite to request removal of our trademark from this web site without success.\r\nThis company is not a BBB member or a BBBOnLine Reliability program\r\nparticipant and so this use of our trademark constitutes trademark\r\ninfringement as well as false advertising. We are concerned that the public\r\nwill be misled about this company's status with the BBB if they continue to\r\ndisplay our trademark.  Given our failed efforts to contact the site's\r\nowner, I write to you to request that you, as web host, remove the BBBONLINE\r\nRELIABILITY Logo from the site mentioned above.\r\n\r\nIn case you are unaware, the Council is the owner of the BBBONLINE\r\nRELIABILITY Logo in the United States (Reg. Nos. 2,638,567, 2,638,568,\r\n2,653,511, and 2,653,512).  This mark may only be used in limited ways by\r\nauthorized members that have entered into a licensing agreement with an\r\napproved BBB.  It is essential that we protect it from infringement or\r\nmisuse and the public from misunderstandings about the relationship of\r\ncompanies with the BBB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI trust that you understand how important it is for the Council to protect\r\nits marks, and I thank you for your help.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVictoria Doran\r\n\r\nDeputy General Counsel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ncc:  R. Copelan, Santa Barbara, CA BBB\r\n\r\n     E.
