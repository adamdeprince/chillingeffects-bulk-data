I requested he remove it. He/she totally ignored my emails. I then put in a .htaccess file which substituted a rather rude photograph instead.\r\n\r\nHe has circumvented this by linking to the image in your cache.\r\n\r\nThe link on his page is &lt;a href=/photos/photo-www.drivingschoolireland.com/image/enya.jpg http://www.drivingschoolireland.com/enya.html&h=480&w=640&sz=71 &tbnid=LtHame6yszgJ:&tbnh=l 01 &tbnw=135&hl=en&start=8&prev=/images%3Fq%3DENYA%26svnum%3D 10%26hl%3Den%261r% 3D%26ie%3D UTF-8&gt;&lt;img\r\nsrc=http://images.google.comlmages?q=tbn:LtHame6yszgJ:www.drivingschoolireland.com/image/eny a.jpg width=135 height=101&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nOn his page http://www.mp3-find.com/photos_ENYA-0.asp\r\n\r\nThe original photo is www.drivingschoolireland.com/enya.html\r\n\r\nHe ignored my further emails\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury he has disabled right click on his web site, claiming copyright.
