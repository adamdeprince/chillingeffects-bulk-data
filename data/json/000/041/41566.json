The sites are part of something called Global \r\nWizz and have such URLs as www.mycarszone.com and www.carswizz.com.\r\n\r\nI know this for a fact, because they have misappropriated some of my \r\nwork.  They have never requested nor received permission from me or my \r\ncompany for its use.  One such example can be found at \r\nhttp://www.mycarszone.com/news/news_969.html.\r\n\r\nI expect you to take immediate action as your support of their illegal \r\naction makes you a contributory infringer, and subject to Federal and State \r\nintellectual property law penalties.\r\n\r\nFeel free to call me if you need additional information.\r\n\r\nMarc J.
