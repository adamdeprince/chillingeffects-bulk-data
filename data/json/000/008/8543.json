(\"Lyons Partnership\"), the owners of children's character Barney the Purple Dinosaur.\r\n\r\nIt has come to the attention of Lyons Partnership that you are operating a website found at http://drwho.virtadpt.net/pictures/october-2002-furbecue.  Your website depicts a plush Barney toy in a violent manner or position.  We are writing to request that you remove this violent content towards Barney on your website in the interest of protecting children on the Internet.\r\n\r\nBarney is a character created for children.

In this \"digital age\" in which we live, children are exposed to the Internet at a very early age.  Content such as the violent Barney subject matter on your website could be very disturbing to a chlid who is looking for fan sites dedicated to barney.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we request that you remove the violent Barney content on your website.
