I am hence using this form rather than the  \nblogger complaint form so that I can speed up this matter.  The blog  \nauthor, a one Mr Basheer Fremaux Soormally, has published a significant  \npersonal email of mine that I sent to him via Yahoo mail, effectively  \nmaking it accessible publicly.  My email to him was a request for him to  \nremove content from another external blog where my name is cited.  However,  \nMr Soormally has now added the request to his own blog, stating that he  \nwill not make any changes until I explain my objections [I HAVE!! - HE WILL  \nNOT ACCEPT IT - I AM CONCERNED THAT MR SOORMALLY WILL SIMPLY PUBLISH MORE  \nMATERIAL IF I CONTACT HIM AGAIN].  This information is injurious to me in  \nthat persons desirous to google my name for business reasons (I run a full  \ntime school in the UK) are now directed towards my \"dispute\" with him as  \nopposed to my business activity (education).  Mr Soormally refuses to  \ncommunicate or respond to my calls and emails.  I simply require the email  \nhe has published to be removed and all references to my name removed from  \nhis blog - I desire no censorship of his words however.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://muhammad-ali-ben-marcus.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/american-nation-of-muhammad.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
