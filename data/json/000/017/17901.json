We are cartoonists. I think a 6th grader could figure out\r\nwe are not trying to pose as members of Mensa. We sell products with this image on it(among 6500 other images) but in no way do we even\r\nTRY to play games.  It is pure and simple parody/satire. I am no Mensa and maybe its better I'm not. At least I have a sense of humor and understand parody.  \r\n\r\nI used to respect the organization.  Now it's very very sad.  Too bad.\r\n\r\nHere is the evil offending cartoon that has them steaming mad and\r\nready to sue me. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.londonstimes.us/toons/cartoons/display.html?image=johann_einstein.jpg","date_sent":"2006-11-08T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-11-08T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Copyright and Fair Use"],"sender_name":"Venable LLP","principal_name":"Marilyn Overheu","recipient_name":"London Group","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
