I have a copyright\r\ninfringement issue that could be described as pretty humorous.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour customer's domain: www.mayidasoft.com <http://www.mayidasoft.com/> \r\n\r\nOur domain: www.webmarketingnow.com <http://www.webmarketingnow.com/> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow, what makes this humorous is how I caught these guys. They not only\r\ncopied my design, but kept many of the internal links to our site (which\r\nwere absolute), but the worst was that they actually kept our web stat\r\ntracking code, so they showed up in our referral logs.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am requesting that this site be taken down due to this obvious violation.\r\nI hope you can comply as soon as you pick yourself up off the floor from\r\nlaughing for how stupid these people were.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMuch thanks,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJerry West\r\n\r\nWeb Marketing Now\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-02-07T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-07T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Web Marketing Now","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
