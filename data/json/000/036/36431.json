I am writing to report a site(s) on your \r\nserver that has been using\r\nstolen content of mine for the past 3 months. http://www.plumpercuties.com\r\n3 months ago he was told by me to remove 2 sites that were mine.\r\nThis was after an ongoing problem of not getting paid on time. He told me\r\nthe \r\nsites were removed.\r\nWell, I discovered last night that for the past 3 months he still had all my\r\n\r\ncontent up in his members area.\r\nAfter talking to him today (which I have the whole conversation saved with \r\ntimestamps if you would like to read it - he admits to still having the\r\ncontent \r\nup for the past three months and that he \"forgot\" to remove it)\r\nI tried reasoning with him and telling him I would accept 180.00 for the\r\npast \r\n3 months and give him permission to continue to use the content. He refuses \r\nto listen to reason.\r\nWell, I just found more of my content up on his site(s) which he says has \r\nbeen taken down! He asked where it was, I refuse to tell him, because IF HE\r\nDOES \r\nNOT KNOW WHERE HE HAS MY CONTENT HE HAS NO BUSINESS BEING A WEBMASTER!\r\nNow, he has used my content illegally for 3 months and is continuing to do \r\nso. I want one of 2 things done. Either\r\nhis sites be taken down immediately  or he reimburses me for all this time\r\nof \r\nusing my content illegally.\r\nIf this is not accomplished within a few days, I will take him and you to \r\ncourt (as you are hosting his sites)\r\nMelody Shephard\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n","date_sent":"2004-10-12T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-10-12T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Melody Shephard","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
