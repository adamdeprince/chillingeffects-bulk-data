You can see at a glance most of the actual content is totally identical.  This site has only had this content for the past few days, because it has only just flagged up on our site stats!\r\n\r\nHere should be enough proof for you that the site is an illegal copy:\r\n\r\n* Firstly, the page's main title reads 'Data Insight (GIS)', which matches OUR site's content.\r\n* They claim our 'Business Partners' are theirs -- which we can easily prove otherwise.  Our partners are linking to our site.  For example -- https://www2.esriuk.com/partners/search_part_directory.asp?sector=&coname=Data+Insight+%28GIS%29+Limited&prodname=\r\n* There are NO contact details for their company -- besides an e-mail address.\r\n* All of the dynamic content is missing, such as our calendar and contact form (since they can't copy the PHP files).\r\n* Their site is missing the W3C validation branding, and if you W3C check certain pages on their site, e.g. their contact page, it fails on many problems whereas our site passes.\r\n* The textual content does not have good English where it has been altered or new text content has been added.\r\n* The StatCounter javascript code has been stolen -- because we are now seeing hits on their website.  Visit here for proof: http://statcounter.com/project/standard/stats.php?project_id=6450103&guest=1\r\n* The Google webmaster stats javascript code has been also stolen.\r\n\r\nThe wordpress theme we have used is an open one, with some adjustments.  However, almost ALL of the textual and image content has been stolen.  You can clearly see we acknowledge the original author of the Wordpress theme (as per request) at the bottom of our page.  The copied site does not have this acknowledgement -- they are claiming the whole site is theirs!\r\n\r\nThis is obviously theft, and we would be most grateful if you could take this website offline or remove it from web search results.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nSteve Ainsworth\r\nData Insight (GIS) Limited \r\n37 High Street\r\nAlton\r\nHampshire\r\nGU34 1BD\r\n\r\nPhone: +44 (0) 1420 544288\r\nFax: +44 (0) 1420 549488\r\n\r\nOur registered UK company number is: 07080810\r\nadministrator@datainsight.co.uk","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.datainsight-group.com/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.datainsight.co.uk/"}]},{"description":"www.datainsight-group.com is a fraudulent copy of our website: www.datainsight.co.uk\r\n\r\nThis is a company, based in India (NOT associated with us), that has taken our website content and is using it in an effort to take our business from us.
