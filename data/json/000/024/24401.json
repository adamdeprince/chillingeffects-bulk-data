We demand that, upon receipt\r\nof this notification of claimed infringement, you expeditiously notify the\r\nsubscriber or account holder to whom you assigned the IP address(es) on the\r\ndate(s) listed and demand that he or she immediately remove the infringing\r\nmaterial and cease and desist trading or sharing TITAN Media property.\r\nUnder 17 U.S.C. 512(i), service providers are not eligible for the\r\nlimitations on liability established by 17 U.S.C. 512 [including those\r\nestablished in subsection (a)] unless they have adopted and reasonably\r\nimplemented, and informed subscribers and account holders a policy that\r\nprovides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers and\r\naccount holders who are repeat infringers.  Informing subscribers and\r\naccount holders of acts of infringement is a crucial element to a policy\r\nproviding for the termination of repeat infringers.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of TITAN Media's\r\nlegal position, nor is it a waiver of any of our rights and/or remedies in\r\nthis or any other matter, all of which are expressly reserved.
