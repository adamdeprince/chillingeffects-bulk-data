I have personally cooked it and photographed it for my recipe  \nwebsite. The infringing site is definitely a repeat offender, because this\n \nis not the first time I've been reporting them for DMCA infringment. I\nhave  \nreplaced the reported image on my original page with higher quality of the\n \nsame image, because it seems to me that a lot of times sites that copy my \n\nimages rank higher with my own images and therefore stealing my income\nfrom  \ngoogle ads. Thank you for your time.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.wizardrecipes.com/recipes/manicotti.html"},{"url":"http://www.wizardrecipes.com/upload/Manicotti.jpg"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.finestchef.com/Manicotti.htm"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
