Please see the screenshot below. I also enclose a letter of\r\nauthority from our client, Cricket Australia. The Third game in the\r\nseries began last night and continues until Monday- so it is obviously\r\nimperative that the site is prevented from streaming the cricket as\r\nquickly as possible. \r\n\r\nPlease advise what action you can take against the site.\r\n\r\nI, Mike Kiernan, hereby state that Cricket Australia is the owner of the\r\nexclusive rights referenced above and that NetResult is authorised to\r\nact on its behalf with respect to internet monitoring and compliance. On\r\nbehalf of Cricket Australia, I hereby state that I have a good faith\r\nbelief that use of the content in the manner complained of is not\r\nauthorised by Cricket Australia, its agents, or the law.\r\n\r\nI, Mike Kiernan, as a representative of NetResult hereby digitally sign\r\nthis e-mail message under penalty of perjury under the laws of the\r\nUnited States of America with the additional statement under penalty of\r\nperjury that the information in the notice is accurate.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Kiernan \r\n\r\nNetResult\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMike Kiernan\r\n\r\nAccount Executive\r\n\r\nProjector NetResult Ltd\r\nMulberry House,\r\n583 Fulham Road,\r\nLondon,\r\nSW6 5UA \r\n\r\nmikek@nr-online.com <mailto:mikek@nr-online.com> \r\nhttp://www.nr-online.com <http://www.nr-online.com/>  \r\n\r\ntel: \r\n  \r\n\r\n+44 (0)20 7471 1733\r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: The Planet Legal Response Team [mailto:LegalResponse@theplanet.com\r\n<mailto:LegalResponse@theplanet.com> ]\r\nSent: 08 December 2006 21:13\r\nTo: MikeK@nr-online.com\r\nSubject: [Fwd: FW: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166]\r\n\r\nPlease note that the domain referenced in your DMCA notice does not\r\nreside within our network as of 03:12 PM --600 (Central Standard Time),\r\nFriday, December 08  2006.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThe Planet-EV1 Legal Response Team\r\nhttps://www.theplanet.com/index.html?p=legal\r\n<https://www.theplanet.com/index.html?p=legal> \r\n(214)782-7800 :: 1-800-377-6103\r\nFax:: (214) 782-7756\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Mike Kiernan [mailto:MikeK@nr-online.com\r\n<mailto:MikeK@nr-online.com> ]\r\nSent: Friday, December 08, 2006 4:34 AM\r\nTo: Copyright\r\nSubject: FW: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\n\r\nDear Sirs,\r\n\r\nI don't understand why the fact that you need to log-in to\r\nwww.wahegurson.com is relevent? We have been trying to take action\r\nagainst this site for some time as it is breaking the copyright of two\r\nof our clients. We have provided a large amount of evidence that the\r\nsite is offering illegal streams of cricket. I include screenshots that\r\nmakes it absolutely clear that this is the case. In one of the\r\nscreenshots the site owner says \"WE TELECAST TODAY PAK VS WI\".\r\n\r\nOne of our clients, Echostar Satellite L.L.C, are being infringed by the\r\nsite offering illegal streams of the Pakistan v West Indies Series. I\r\nfeel I must warn you that Echostar are currently looking to prosecute\r\nerrant ISPs, and a failure to cooperate over this issue will leave us\r\nwith little choice but to recommend ThePlanet as a potential candidate\r\nfor such action. This is not a course of action that we wish to take, as\r\nNetResult has enjoyed a good relationship with ThePlanet in the past.\r\n\r\nPlease take action against this site as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMike Kiernan\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: Copyright [mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com\r\n<mailto:Copyright@theplanet.com> ]\r\nSent: 30 November 2006 18:25\r\nTo: mikek@nr-online.com\r\nCc: Theplanet@chillingeffects.org\r\nSubject: FW: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\n\r\n To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nThe URL in question is currently not accessible as of 12:26:22 p.m.\r\n(GMT-6) on November 30, 2006 because it requires proprietary log-in\r\ninformation to access it.\r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\nThe Planet\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuse@ev1.net [mailto:abuse@ev1.net <mailto:abuse@ev1.net> ]\r\nPosted At: Wednesday, November 29, 2006 5:16 AM Posted To: DMCA\r\nConversation: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\nSubject: [EV1-C1976176J] Pakistan v West Indies Series 2006\r\ninfringments- EchoStar_NRID14166\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Forwarded Ticket ====\r\n1.
