The\r\nIFPI is a trade association that represents over 1,400 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings (the \"IFPI Represented\r\nCompanies\").\r\n\r\nUnder penalty of perjury, we submit that we are authorized to act on behalf\r\nof the IFPI Represented Companies in matters involving the infringement of\r\ntheir sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law\r\nrights on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above web sites on your\r\nnetwork.  These sites are offering direct links to files containing sound\r\nrecordings for other users to download. The copyright in these sound\r\nrecordings is owned or exclusively controlled by certain IFPI Represented\r\nCompanies.\r\n\r\nWe have a good faith belief that the above-described activity is not\r\nauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nWe assert that the information in this notification is accurate, based upon\r\nthe data available to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing links\r\nfrom your system or that you disable access to the infringing links, and\r\nthat you inform the site operator(s) of the illegality of his or her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nWe also note that under Google's Blogger DMCA Policy, Google will, in\r\nappropriate circumstances, terminate the accounts of repeat infringers and\r\nthat under the Blogger Content Policy Google reserves the right to\r\nterminate accounts that are used for unlawful purposes.\r\n\r\nOur top priority is to prevent the continued availability of the IFPI\r\nRepresented Companies' content on the internet.  Unauthorized copies of\r\nsound recordings that are freely available, especially pre-release\r\nrecordings, cause substantial damage to the IFPI Represented Companies\r\nevery hour and day they remain available.  In sending a notice in this\r\nform, we are seeking to ensure that infringing content is removed from the\r\ninternet as quickly as possible through your cooperation.  However, please\r\nnote that we do not admit that we or the IFPI Represented Companies are\r\nresponsible for detecting infringing material and notifying you of it.\r\n\r\nWe also do not admit that you are within the protection of the DMCA safe\r\nharbors or that prompt removal of links according to this notice is\r\nsufficient for you to avoid potential liability under applicable copyright\r\nlaws, though it may mitigate your exposure.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator(s) may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on\r\nyour service. In addition, your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement. This notice does not constitute a waiver of any\r\nright to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized\r\nactivities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are\r\nexpressly reserved.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at IFPI Secretariat, [redacted], London W1J 0DD,\r\nUnited Kingdom or email [redacted]ifpi.org, to discuss this notice.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have submitted a signature to be placed on file with\r\nGoogle.\r\n\r\nWe await your response.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n[redacted]\r\nVice-President, Internet Anti-Piracy\r\nIFPI\r\n[redacted]\r\nLondon\r\nW1J 0DD\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\nEmail: [redacted]ifpi.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2008-05-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-05-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":"Director, Internet Anti-Piracy","principal_name":"IFPI","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.
