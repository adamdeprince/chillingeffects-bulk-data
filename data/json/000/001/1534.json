{"dmca":{"id":1534,"type":"Dmca","title":"Re: re-code.com","body":"Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n\tThis firm is counsel to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Wal-Mart has learned of a website found at www.re-code.com.  Re-code.com is registered anonymously through your service. This site encourages the public to participate in a modern-day version of the old scam in which a customer takes a price sticker from a cheap item and puts it on a more expensive item before handing it to the checkout person.  Re-code.com provides a forum for consumers to shares and print out barcode information for inexpensive items at stores such as Wal-Mart, and them take them to Wal-Mart and place tem on top of the legitimate bar code for more expensive items.  Wal-Mart barcodes are specifically made available on the website.\r\n\r\n\tAs such, re-code.com is encouraging and facilitating theft and fraud against Wal Mart.  This is clearly in violation of your own policy as well as illegal.  As such, Wal-Mart demands that you immediately shut down this website and that you provide us with contact information for the real registrant of re-code.com pursuant to Paragraph 4 of your customer agreement.  We would also like to see a list of other domain names this person has registered with you so that we can confirm whether they also violate Wal Mart","date_sent":"2003-04-02T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-04-02T05:00:00Z","topics":["John Doe Anonymity","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Venable, Baetjer, Howard, & Civiletti, LLP","principal_name":"Venable, Baetjer, Howard, & Civiletti, LLP","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
