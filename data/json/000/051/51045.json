It has come to our attention that a website you host, www.el-tunes.com, is currently distributing software designed to circumvent Apple's FairPlay digital rights management system. The website is offering three such files for download -- available at http://www.el-tunes.com/eltunes_0.1-0_i386.deb, http://www.el-tunes.com/eltunes_0.1-0.tar.gz, and http://www.el-tunes.com/eltunes-0.1.tar.gz -- and instructions for installation and/or use of same.\r\n\r\nThese files consist primarily of Apple copyrighted software. Unauthorized dissemination of copyrighted software is strictly prohibited. Because they circumvent Apple's FairPlay system, the files and/or their related executables may also be considered circumvention devices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. The DMCA specifically prohibits the distribution and trafficking of circumvention devices.\r\n\r\nBecause the entire website is devoted to the illegal distribution of the aforementioned software, Apple requests that you immediately disable www.el-tunes.com. Please notify me by reply e-mail once you have done so, and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your cooperation\r\n###","date_sent":"2008-07-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-07-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Anticircumvention (DMCA)","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Apple Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
