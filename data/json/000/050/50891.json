In the center is a familiar tape messages. Adding messages is largely running on the same principle and that the Buzz \u2013 typing a message, insert the video, images, links that are automatically executed in view of the annotation with thumbnails, set who sees this message. This can be a person from outside as well as participant G +, can be round or extended community \u2013 then the message will appear as your friends, and friends of friends, you can make a presentation and public.\r\n\r\nCircles \u2013 these are the circles of interests, social relations, cultural exchanges, etc. It\u2019s simple \u2013 you show who added you and whom you have added to, and offer to add anyone else. To my great happiness \u2013 are offering gently, starting from the with whom you have ever contacted. Needless to add, and you can by hand \u2013 in one or several circles. A similar principle of operation and, say, Diaspora \u2013 only there instead of community aspects. Generally it is worth noting that the Plus is more like it is the Diaspora, rather than Facebook or Twitter. And adding people and adding records \u2013 looks almost the same. Unless there already have a base and even some content, not to mention hype.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://applemacimark.wordpress.com/2011/07/09/so-its-been-a-while-but-google-and-mac-osx-lion-along-with-a-revamped-youtube-layout-is-certainly-exciting/"},{"url":"http://www.digitalexpertsolutions.com/2011/07/14/bring-on-the-beta-google/"},{"url":"http://www.emi-grants.com/vb/t307786.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.nichewp.com/google-plus-review.html"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
