I have  \nreceived certification from local, state, and federal officials certifying  \ntheir compliance with the judge's order. All public websites have removed  \nthe record they had with the exception of www.offendex.com\n\nIt has been years that myself and my attorney have attempted to contact the  \nwebsite administrator to no avail. They hide their info through WhoIs. When  \nwe sent info via the contact info provided by their website hosting company  \nin Australia they never replied. We have recently informed the FBI because  \nthey are an out of USA site and a file has been opened.\n\nThe section that mandates this removal and that all record be void and  \nstricken is the second and last paragraphs.\n\nWe respectfully pray that as a last recourse, Google will stop indexing all  \nreferences to Jonathan Ngandjong from http://www.offendex.com to prevent  \nany further unfair miscarriage of justice.\n\nThank You\nfull_name: Jonathan Ngandjong\ngeolocation: US\nhidden_ctx:\nhidden_product: websearch\nurl_box2_1: http://www.offendex.com\n","date_sent":"2012-11-14T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2012-11-14T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
