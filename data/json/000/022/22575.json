In 2006, I had a litigation with an business partner  \nthat finally lead to a break of our business relations. In the same\nperiod,  \nI have noticed that I was the subject of an anonymous online slandering  \ncampaign.\n\nSince 2006, this link results in the very first page of the Google search \n\n(also in the gigaalert.com).\n\nI'm a PhD student now and I'm working with a prestigious NGO combating  \nracism and antiSemitism and people still ask me about the related link  \nrevealed by a simple Google search with my name.\n\nI would like to express my deep discontent about this indefinite  \nslander-page appearing for so many years in the Google's - first page  \nsearch results. Removing the link from the Google search would not  \ncompensate the reputation damage already made, but it would finally stop\nit.\n\nThank you for your attention.\n\nKind regards,\nMarius\n+44 (0)798 4140 302\n\nurl_box3_1:","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://www.swf.ro/modules.php?op=modload&name=XForum&file=print&fid=6&tid=727"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
