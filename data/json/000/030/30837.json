These files contain sound\r\nrecordings by the artist known as Marillion.  These sound recordings are\r\nowned by one of our member companies and have not been authorized for\r\nthis kind of use.  We have a good faith belief that the above-described\r\nactivity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the\r\nlaw.

In addition, please inform the site operator of the\r\nillegality of his or her conduct.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that\r\nthis site operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring\r\non your service. In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright\r\nAct, if you ignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be\r\nliable for any resulting infringement.
