(\"Lyons Partnership\"), the owners of children's character Barney<AE> the Purple Dinosaur. \r\n\r\n        It has come to the attention of Lyons Partnership that you are operating a website found at URL: http://www.funhouse.com/jfw/mount.bob.photos/mind_of_evil. Your website depicts a plush Barney toy in a violent manner or position. We are writing to request that you remove this violent content towards Barney on your website in the interest of protecting children on the Internet.\r\n\r\n        Barney is a character created for children. Although Barney's primary audience is children aged two to five, children who are somewhat older also watch and enjoy the program. In this \"digital age\" in which we live, children are exposed to the Internet at a  very early age. Content such as the violent Barney subject matter on your website could be very disturbing to a child who is looking for fan sites dedicated to Barney.\r\n\r\n        Therefore, we request that you remove the violent Barney content on your website. Please contact the undersigned if you require additional information.\r\n\r\n                                                                \r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Sincerely, \r\n\r\n                                        GIBNEY, ANTHONY & FLAHERTY, LLP\r\n                                                \r\n                                        \r\n                                                \r\n                                        By: _________________________________\r\n                                                        [private]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS:\\INTLPROP\\01426 -LyonsGroup\\Letter\\funhouse.com.jfw.mount.bob.photos.mind_of_evil.doc\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to which it is addressed, and may contain information that is privileged confidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.
