The copyrighted work at issue is the Travel Industry Dictionary that appears at www.HomeTravelAgency.com/dictionary and subsequent pages.\r\n\r\nHere are some search queries that result in the display of material that infringes on my copyright.\r\n\r\nSearch query\tOffending URL\r\ndefine:rack rate\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.R.html\r\ndefine:leisure travel\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.L.html\r\ndefine:concierge\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.C.html \r\ndefine:continental\r\nbreakfast\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.C.html\r\ndefine:customs\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.C.html\r\ndefine:inn\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.I.html\r\ndefine:b&b\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.B.html\r\ndefine:american\r\nplan\t\twww.episodestravel.com/dic.A.html\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless others that could be cited.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that in some cases my copyrighted definition appears along with the infringing material. In other cases, only the stolen definition appears. In fact, the infringer's stolen definitions seem to appear in Google search results more frequently than the real thing! You will also note that the links provided after the infringing definitions do not lead to a dictionary, as the \r\nURLs would lead you to believe, but to a page from a \"search engine\" called TopDotz.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the infringing party has stolen my copyrighted material and then used it to fool Google into directing traffic to TopDotz. Ironically, then, the infringing material appears not on a page at episodestravel.com but on google.com itself.\r\n\r\nA Whois search for episodestravel.com shows that the domain is registered as follows: \r\nDomain Name: EPISODESTRAVEL.COM\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\nTraffic, Keyword [private]@[private]\r\n[private]\r\n[private], WA 98230-xxxx \r\nUS x xxx xxx xxxx-xx\r\n\r\nA Whois search for topdotz.com reveals the following:\r\nDomain Name: TOPDOTZ.COM\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\nKeyword Traffic, Premium [private]@[private]\r\n[private]\r\n[private], WA 98230-xxxx \r\nUS xxx xxx xxxx-xx\r\n\r\nHowever, the domain keywordtraffic.info does not seem to exist.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described  above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n[private]\r\nxxx-xxx-xxxx \r\n[private]@[private]","date_sent":"2004-07-26T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-07-26T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"The Intrepid Traveler","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
