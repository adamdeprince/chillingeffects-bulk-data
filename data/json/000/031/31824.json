The first one was for ripping my proposed layout and this time, changes to your layout, which you did NOT propose before me and did NOT show screenshots of prior to the changes while I had.\r\n\r\nI request that you either call me or email me directly instead of dismissing me because I am receieving literally hundreds of emails showing support and suggestions that the Google re-design is a bit too close to my proposed re-design for comfort.\r\n\r\nIn a court of law, if two items can easily be mistaken while the first item had been publicly proposed and suggested, the second item is in direct Copyright violation.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that you either STOP stealing my stuff or BUY the full design, at which point I will make it more user friendly stripping out the noise and unnecessary concepts.\r\n\r\nYou need to remember, you're never too big to be sued by the small guy!","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.google.com/"},{"url":"http://www.google.co.uk/"},{"url":"http://www.google.com/results"},{"url":"http://www.google.co.uk/results"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/203026-Google-Images-results-concept-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195789-Google-Header-Tweaked-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195776-Google-main-page-nav-tweaked-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195767-Google-filters-tweaked-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195469-New-Google-Results-Page-new-header-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195387-New-Google-Results-Page-Concept-"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195379-New-Google-Results-Page"},{"url":"http://dribbble.com/shots/195100-New-Google-Search-Homepage/attachments/3281"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
