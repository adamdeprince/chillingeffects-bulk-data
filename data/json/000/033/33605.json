An Arin whois lookup revealed that the\r\nIP address is registered to EV1 Servers, now The Planet. I have sent\r\nthis email to both abuse@ev1servers.net and abuse@theplanet.com in order\r\nto hopefully resolve this matter quickly. \r\n \r\nDine Here (www.dinehere.ca) is a web site originally created in Nov 2004\r\nwhich is dedicated to restaurant reviews for Greater Vancouver, Victoria\r\nand Whistler BC. We are an authority dining site, probably the most\r\npopular in BC, Canada. Interestingly enough, we are also hosted at EV1\r\non a dedicated server we recently procured from your company. \r\n \r\nDiningblogs.com [www.diningblogs.com] have blatantly stolen the\r\nrestaurant information (and design) from dinehere.ca, a quick inspection\r\nof both web sites will confirm this fact.  \r\n \r\nThe domain diningblogs.com was registered on November 27th, 2006, over 2\r\nyears after dinehere.ca was registered and operating. A review of the\r\nInternet Archive for Dine Here\r\n[http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.dinehere.ca] clearly shows that\r\nwe have been operating with precendance of the content that is in\r\ndispute. \r\n \r\nThe domain diningblogs.com's registration information is being hidden\r\nusing a 3rd party privacy service which further complicates matters. We\r\nhave attempted to contact the webmasters of diningblogs.com using their\r\ncontact form on their web site and have not received any response. \r\n \r\nWe consider the restaurant names, address, phone #s, restaurant cuisine\r\nclassifications, and location classifications all copyrighted\r\ninformation that is property of Dine Here. Our intellectual property has\r\nbeen stolen to create their web site. \r\n \r\nThis is a clear breach of acceptable terms of use posted on your web\r\nsite. \r\nWe require immediate action which should include termination of their\r\nservice and deactivation of this web site to resolve this matter. \r\n \r\nPlease respond as soon as you can, we consider this matter urgent. \r\n \r\nRegards,\r\n~Chad \r\n \r\n--\r\nChad DeGroot\r\n604-739-1048 ","date_sent":"2007-01-18T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-18T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Chad DeGroot","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
