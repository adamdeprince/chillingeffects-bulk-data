I have since had the story removed from the site. On doing a Google search there is still a thread link with my name and email address that comes up. On Google Group search the link also appears including my name and email address. Since I have removed the story from the original site, and the only site I had submitted it to I would like to have these links removed from the Google searches.The copyrighted work at issue is the text that appears on http://groups&#8209;\r\nbeta.google.com/group/alt.sex.stories.moderated/msg/ee21ddbc050a8405?hl=en\r\n\r\n2.
