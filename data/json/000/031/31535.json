(\"Pearson\"), which owns\r\namong other imprints the Addison Wesley, Cisco Press, Prentice Hall, Que,\r\nand Sams publishing imprints.   It has come to Pearson's attention that your\r\nwebsite, http://www.betah.co.il/bookscatalog.aspx?category=programming\r\n<http://www.betah.co.il/bookscatalog.aspx?category=programming>  (the\r\n\"Website\"), reproduces and distributes unauthorized digital copies of\r\napproximately 24 Pearson works (\"Works\"), examples of which are specified in\r\nExhibit A contained herein.\r\n\r\nPearson has not authorized copies of these proprietary Works to be\r\nreproduced or distributed from your Website, or any other website, and we\r\nare not aware that you have ever sought our permission to do so - permission\r\nwhich in any case would not have been granted. Therefore, the unauthorized\r\nreproduction and distribution of the Works on the Website are clear and\r\nwillful infringements of Pearson's copyright and exclusive rights as the\r\npublisher of the Works under United States copyright law and international\r\ncopyright treaties\r\n                \r\nBe advised that Pearson considers infringement of any kind to be a grave\r\nmatter and Pearson vigorously protects its proprietary interests in its\r\nWorks. Therefore, as an initial matter, Pearson hereby demands that you\r\nconfirm in writing that you will immediately cease and desist all further\r\nreproduction, display and making available for download of the Works on the\r\nWebsite.\r\n\r\nThe demands made in this electronic mail shall not waive or prejudice any\r\nrights or remedies which Pearson may have in connection with this matter,\r\nincluding the right to commence legal action and to seek injunctive relief,\r\nif necessary, without further notice to you.\r\n\r\nPearson expects a response confirming that the Work will be removed from\r\nyour Website no later than five (5) business days from your receipt of this\r\nelectronic mail.\r\n\r\nFinally, you are hereby placed on notice that you are not authorized to, in\r\nany manner, distribute such materials and therefore that any further\r\ndistribution will be deemed to be intentional and willful violation of our\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nLaShonda Morris\r\n\r\ncc: abuse@theplanet.com\r\n\r\n                <EXHIBIT A>\r\n\r\n1.
