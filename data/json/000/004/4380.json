Please explain how this came to be, and what you intend to do about it. I have passed the information on to a racism-monitoring agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Private] D.Phil (Oxon), MA(Econ)\r\n","date_sent":"2004-12-12T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-12-12T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","International"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Law Offices of Brian Schneider","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
