The only response I've got was  \non June 16 saying you would investigate and get back to me. It is my belief  \nthat the original claim was false, and was only filed because of the  \nsimilarity between the two apps, the only reason they were similar was  \nbecause, as I said before, the two apps use the same api from the same  \nwebsite. Also because my app, in my opinion, was better, responded faster,  \nlooked nicer, and was not as \"laggy\". In fact, after my app was pulled from  \nthe market they made significant changes to UI and now it looks more like  \nmine. They also used the name Bitcoin Trader on github where they have  \nreleased the code as opensource under the apache licence.\n\nSo I'm requesting again to have my app reinstated to the market.\n\nThanks,\n  Dave\n\nPS: Could I get a better response other that we will investigate... Like  \nmaybe an estimate of how long it will take?\ndmca_consent_statement: checked\ndmca_consent_statementtwo: checked\ndmca_signature: Dave Akers\ndmca_signature_date_day: 30\ndmca_signature_date_month: 06\ndmca_signature_date_year: 2011\nform: dmca_counter\nfull_name: Dave Akers\nhidden_product: androidmarket\norigin: helpcenter\nphone: 6052285347\nyour_title: Mr.\n","date_sent":"2011-06-30T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2011-06-30T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Counter","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
