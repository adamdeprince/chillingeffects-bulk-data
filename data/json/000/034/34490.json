We have posted a message for that person before\r\nwhen they accessed site at prior time (couple of weeks ago) also using\r\nEveryone Internet but different IP address. That means that person has\r\nbeen notified that activities they performed are illegal and we asked\r\nthe person to contact us if it is misunderstanding. There has been no\r\nresponse. \r\nToday's access was between 2:31AM and 9:13AM Boston time. \r\n \r\nPlease attend to the manner immediately before it is unnecessarily\r\nescalates. \r\n \r\nRegards,\r\nMark Khayter\r\n617-512-5967\r\nmkhayter@ComplianceDoc.com","date_sent":"2006-09-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-09-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"www.ComplianceDoc.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
