The RIAA is a trade\r\nassociation whose member companies create, manufacture and distribute\r\napproximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound recordings\r\nsold in the United States. Under penalty of perjury, we submit that\r\nthe RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies on\r\nmatters involving the infringement of their sound recordings,\r\nincluding enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above Web sites on\r\nyour network. These sites are offering direct links to files on other\r\nInternet sites containing full-length sound recordings for other users\r\nto download, including songs by such artists as Fall Out Boy, Incubus\r\nand Bloc Party. We have a good faith belief that the above-described\r\nactivity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the\r\nlaw.

Specifically, we request that you remove the\r\nsites or the infringing links from your system and that you inform the\r\nsite operator of the illegality of his or her conduct.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute a waiver of any right to recover\r\ndamages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized activities, and\r\nsuch rights as well as claims for other relief are expressly retained.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at RIAA, 1025 F Street N.W., 10th Floor,\r\nWashington, D.C. 20004, Tel.
