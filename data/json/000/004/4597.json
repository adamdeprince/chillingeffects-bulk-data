The photos have been\ntaken  \nwith my own camera and are owned by me.\n\nThere has been a systemic defamation against me by Bay Area-based elements\n \nassociated with the Iranian regime and Hezbollah because I run a  \ncounter-terrorism website  \n(http://wiki.islamiccounterterrorism.org/article/Main_Page) that exposes  \ntheir presence in our midst. The aim of these people is to destroy my  \nreputation and pressure me.\n\nThey have already systemically  used YouTube, Flickr and Twitter to defame\n \nme and my business. As such, I would like to request that close the\nblogger  \naccount used to defame in this instance.\n\nBTW, one of these images features me with Vint Cerf, the \"Father of the  \nInternet\" and a Sr. VP at Google.\n\nAlso, given that the offenders here have made allegations of terrorism, I \n\nwould like to ask you to please forward the details of this case to the  \nlocal FBI field office (San Jose, CA) for them to investigate this\nnational  \nsecurity matter.\nSincerely,\n-Sam Bazzi\n415-640-5793","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://sambazzi-arcs.blogspot.com/2011/06/sam-bazzi-arcscom.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://sambazzi.com"},{"url":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/sambazzi/)."},{"url":"http://wiki.islamiccounterterrorism.org/article/Main_Page)"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
