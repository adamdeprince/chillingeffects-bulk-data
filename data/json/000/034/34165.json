My books also carry the title \"The Dooley Family History\".\r\n\r\nI will be seeking legal advice on this issue.  Again.. this has been my\r\nresearch and internet title for more than 20 years and it is well documented\r\nas being so both in print AND on the internet.\r\n\r\nI am demanding that your client cease using my title \"The Dooley Family\r\nHistory\" immediately.  Your client's website is located here\r\nhttp://www.genealogy-family-tree-history.com/Dick-Doty/Dooley-Family-History\r\n.html.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at your clients website you will see in the links section that\r\nhe/she has placed a link to one of my websites but has conveniently changed\r\nthe title of my page within the link.  This is unacceptable behavior.\r\n\r\nI wanted to contact your client directly but I could not find an email\r\naddress on his/her website.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and cooperation.\r\n\r\nJohn Dooley\r\nThe Dooley Family History\r\nemail: Dooley-1@Softhome.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCuZupvK/XpJs6oyURArj3AJoCa+EutNB5/Vew6DheE/zM3vUaIQCeM9D4\r\ncjr7FLft21nn+b3b38P4ExM=\r\n=59Zk\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-06-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"John Dooley","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
