I have personally re-checked the website in question and have\r\nfound various violations. For example, the following URL is hosting an\r\nIP text violation. The words \"Generic Cialis\" are considered a violation\r\nof Eli Lilly ICOS's Intellectual Property. The sale of Generic Cialis is\r\nillegal in the United States as is the advertised text, as can be seen\r\nin this URL:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://generic-cialis.my-medicare.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.my-medicare.com/generic-cialis-soft-tabs.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, any\r\npictures of packaging, pills, and or Eli Lilly trademarks are also\r\nconsidered a violation of Eli Lilly's intellectual property. As stated\r\nprior, the case will remain open until these violations are removed.\r\nThank you for your ongoing support in resolving this matter.\r\nPlease let me know if I can be of further assistance, I can be reached\r\nat CMcIntosh@Netenforcers.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCasey\r\nMcIntosh\r\n\r\nLMS Representative\r\n\r\nNet Enforcers\r\nInc.\r\n\r\nCMcIntosh@netenforcers.com\r\n\r\ncompliance.management@netenforcers.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nOnline Enforcement Specialists......\r\n\r\nStatement of Confidentiality\r\n\r\nThe contents\r\nof this e-mail message and any attachments are confidential and are\r\nintended solely for the addressee.
