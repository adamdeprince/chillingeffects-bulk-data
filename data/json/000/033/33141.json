I created the page Naked For Peace to\r\ndocument and share information and various examples of people who chose\r\nto demonstrate for peace in an unusual way. Many people in the world\r\nparticipated in these unusual actions to garner media attention for\r\ntheir cause which is Peace. \r\nSome of the images on the page are my own and some belong to others who\r\nhave  given me permission to share their images. \r\nMy page also has some newspaper images with links back to the original\r\nnewspaper articles that first reported the stories about these peace\r\nactions. \r\n \r\nThe web page does contain my original text  and also has links to other\r\npages within my sfheart.com website. \r\n \r\nAlthough some of the images may be considered provocative to some, none\r\nof the images are of a high enough resolution to clearly identify the\r\npeople who participated in the pictures.  \r\nAnd none of the the page or the links  I provide on the page go to any\r\nwebsite that would be considered as pornographic. \r\nMy website in its entirety is concerned to be family safe. \r\n \r\nThe owner of  biolife.ws has copied images off my  \r\nsite, changed the file names and saved them to their server.   \r\nThey have copied the content of  my entire page, changed some of the\r\ntext and added links to pornographic websites. \r\nMost of the links to other pages on my sfheart.com web site are intact\r\nwhich could lead people to think that biolife.ws is in some way\r\nconnected to my sfheart.com To make matters even worse, their illegal\r\nwork is listed on several search engines. \r\nI happened to find found out about this infringement through my stats\r\nadministration page which showed biolife.ws <www.biolife.ws/>  as one of\r\nthe URLs that visited mine. \r\n \r\n \r\nIt is difficult for me to identify the person who owns biolife\r\n<www.biolife.ws/>.ws and contact them myself because they have no\r\nreachable email contact. \r\nI am writing to you to ask you to remove www.biolife.ws/ from your\r\nserver immediately. \r\nA reply concerning this matter would be appreciated. \r\n \r\nI hereby state under penalty of perjury, that the above information is\r\naccurate and I am the authorized owner of the copyright and intellectual\r\nproperty in question. \r\n \r\nMy name is Nicole Savage\r\naddress: 6340 Geary Blvd\r\nSan Francisco, Ca.94121\r\nphone: (415) 386-4046\r\nemail: nsavage@sfheart.com \r\n \r\n/Nicole Savage/\r\nNicole Savage","date_sent":"2007-01-12T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-12T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Nicole Savage","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
