He has them\r\nidentified by domain as www.seoinfoabout.com and www.theequityguide.com. \r\n \r\nI had a customer give me a heads up about another eBay seller who was\r\noffering similar websites to ours. I investigated and have discovered that\r\nsomehow, he has gained access to the servers and stolen the source files for\r\ntwo of my custom designed sites. I personally designed these websites and\r\nknow for a fact that they are exact duplicates (I have included some url's\r\nof sites that we have done, and then the stolen site that your customer is\r\noffering hereinbelow).  He is offering them on ebay.  Here is his\r\ninformation I got from WhoIs. There is no other way he could have got this.\r\nHe has a hosting company called HostsMaster.net and the registered owner of\r\nthat domain name along with the two stolen website domain names is:\r\n\r\nHostsMaster.net\r\nEric Aaron (sales@hostsmaster.net)\r\n38,\r\nBayswater\r\nLondon,SJ23W\r\nGB\r\nTel. +44.164312933\r\n\r\nI am not really sure how to stop this. This turd is in London and I am in\r\nthe US. I have reported this to eBay but want this guy to not be able to\r\naccess my server space. Can you tell me how this happened and what to do to\r\nprevent it. Can you tell me when he accessed server. I am very concerned\r\nabout this and want to do something.\r\n\r\n1. www.HitsASAP.com (My site) ALso, previous sites I did like this one\r\nhits-alert.com, seo-tipster.com.. I could go on.\r\nwww.SEOINFOABOUT.COM (THIS IS THE STOLEN SITE HOSTED ON YOUR IP)\r\n\r\n2. www.EquityABCs.com (My site) ALso, previous sites I did like this one\r\nweb-lender.com, equity-watch.com..
