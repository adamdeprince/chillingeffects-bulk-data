I don't see any proof in the following email.\r\n\r\n- --- Omar Javaid <admin@ebiz-help.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n| To Whom It May Concern:\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| We have been retained by Ms. Mehreen Mansur in regard to the repeat \r\n| offenses by http://www.ratedesi.com <http://www.ratedesi.com/>\r\n| (http://67.19.89.132/) and\r\n| http://www.ratehispanic.com\r\n| <http://www.ratehispanic.com/>\r\n| (http://67.18.178.100\r\n| <http://67.18.178.100/> ) of unauthorized use of image or likeness.  \r\n| The images can be found at the below linked URL's:\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| http://www.ratedesi.com/view.php?i=13214\r\n|\r\n| http://www.ratedesi.com/view.php?i=65646\r\n| http://www.ratedesi.com/view.php?i=111240\r\n|\r\n| http://www.ratehispanic.com/view.php?i=101\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| Over the span of three years, users from the above mentioned sites \r\n| have used images of our client to falsely misrepresent both her and \r\n| her brother in a variety of fraud ranging from marriage proposals to \r\n| modeling contracts.\r\n| Consequently, Ms. Mansur's reputation has been slandered in the \r\n| tightly knit community in which she lives.  We have been in contact \r\n| with the U.S. Secret Service as well as the Federal Bureau of \r\n| Investigation local field offices which have advised us to approach \r\n| both the webmaster and the hosting provider before seeking police \r\n| action.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| Ms. Mansur has repeatedly attempted to have both the\r\n| likeness of her and her\r\n| brother removed from these sites by contacting the\r\n| site administrator\r\n| numerous times in the last three years.  At best,\r\n| the site administrator was\r\n| skeptical and belligerent and has ignored our\r\n| requests on many occasions.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| We feel that ThePlanet.com as the hosting site\r\n| should be the last line of\r\n| defense against rogue actions of their customers.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| We have procured outside legal counsel to pursue\r\n| this matter and obtain\r\n| financial remedy in a court of law.  Our counsel has\r\n| advised us to attempt\r\n| to have the images removed through the organization\r\n| which hosts the above\r\n| named sites.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| If the images in question are not removed within 72\r\n| hours, we will pursue\r\n| legal action as the only remaining course.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| We are awaiting a swift and judicious response.\r\n|\r\n|\r\n|\r\n| Omar Javaid\r\n|\r\n| Representative\r\n|\r\n| Biz Support Solutions\r\n|\r\n|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCpxPcvK/XpJs6oyURAnkXAJ9Vvdvt+j4i9ou56KlKrfIhRanQ3wCdHmOU\r\nlTfpBVlsXUQgq5eEebVZPMU=\r\n=pJF+\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-06-04T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-04T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Biz Support Solutions (for Mehreen Mansur)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
