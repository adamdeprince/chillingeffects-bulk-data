The IFPI is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies are some 1,500 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies\r\nin matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including\r\nenforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above infringing files on\r\nits network.  These files contain sound recordings by the artist known as\r\nAhlam.  These sound recordings are owned by one of our member companies and\r\nhave not been authorized for this kind of use.  We have a good faith belief\r\nthat the above-described activity is not authorized by the copyright owner,\r\nits agent, or the law.  We assert that the information in this notification\r\nis accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.

In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement.
