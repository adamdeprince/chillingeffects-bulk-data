{"dmca":{"id":11610,"type":"Dmca","title":"Dietfraud.com","body":"The C&D was sent from Canada to the ISP in Pennsylvania on April 10, 2006. I was never contacted by the lawyer in Toronto. I found out about it because all of my web sites were locked out the next day without any notice at all.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't until April 11, 2006 that I received an e-mail with a copy of the fax that was received by 1and1.com in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe lawyer for 1and1.com is from Philadelphia and he refused to talk to me after many phone calls back in April. \r\n\r\nMy web site finally was blocked for good three weeks later, thereby cutting me off from my ability to commuicate over the internet with my patients, and potential patients. \r\n\r\nComplete details are available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://70.103.140.117/~healthwa/\r\n\r\nThe issues involve the opinion of the Canadian attorney that one of my web pages had what they considered trademark violations. There are no trademark violations on that site, there is only fair comment on an advertisement that a Canadian company used to recruit new clients to their weight loss locations across Canada. The specific claims made in that advertisement that were deceptive and untrue were pointed out in the body of the web page. The cease and desist letter was not a legal document. In my opinion the lawyer for the weight loss company acted with malice, and his actions were frivolous and vexatious. They have interfered with my ability to reach my medical patients because the entire web site and its related web sites were blocked. That included all e-mail.
