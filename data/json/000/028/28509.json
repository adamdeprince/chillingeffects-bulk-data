We're committed to providing thorough and unbiased\r\nsearch results for our users. We stop indexing pages of a site only at\r\nthe request of the webmaster who's responsible for those pages, when\r\nit's spamming our index, or as required by law. This policy is necessary\r\nto ensure that pages aren't inappropriately removed from our index.\r\n        \r\n Removal options        \r\nPlease select an option below for instructions. Removals will take\r\neffect the next time Google crawls your site.\r\n\r\n        \r\n*        Remove your entire website\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#exclude_website>  \r\n*        Remove part of your website\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#exclude_pages>  \r\n*        Remove snippets\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#remove_snippets>  \r\n*        Remove cached pages\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#uncache>  \r\n*        Remove an outdated (\"dead\") link\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#outdated>  \r\n*        Remove an image from Google's Image Search\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#images>  \r\n*        Remove a blog from Blog Search\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#blogsearch>  \r\n*        Remove a RSS or Atom feed (i.e., block Feedfetcher)\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#feedfetcher>  \r\n*        Remove transcoded pages\r\n<http://books.google.com/webmasters/remove.html#transcoded>  \r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove your entire website        \r\nIf you wish to exclude your entire website from Google's index, you can\r\nplace a file at the root of your server called robots.txt. This is the\r\nstandard protocol that most web crawlers observe for excluding a web\r\nserver or directory from an index. More information on robots.txt is\r\navailable here: http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html. Please note\r\nthat Googlebot does not interpret a 401/403 response\r\n(\"Unauthorized\"/\"Forbidden\") to a robots.txt fetch as a request not to\r\ncrawl any pages on the site.\r\nTo remove your site from search engines and prevent all robots from\r\ncrawling it in the future, place the following robots.txt file in your\r\nserver root:\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: / \r\nTo remove your site from Google only and prevent just Googlebot from\r\ncrawling your site in the future, place the following robots.txt file in\r\nyour server root:\r\nUser-agent: Googlebot\r\nDisallow: / \r\nEach port must have its own robots.txt file. In particular, if you serve\r\ncontent via both http and https, you'll need a separate robots.txt file\r\nfor each of these protocols. For example, to allow Googlebot to index\r\nall http pages but no https pages, you'd use the robots.txt files below.\r\n\r\nFor your http protocol (http://yourserver.com/robots.txt): \r\nUser-agent: *\r\nAllow: / \r\nFor the https protocol (https://yourserver.com/robots.txt):\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . In order for this\r\nautomated process to work, the webmaster must first create and place a\r\nrobots.txt file on the site in question. \r\nGoogle will continue to exclude your site or directories from successive\r\ncrawls if the robots.txt file exists in the web server root. If you do\r\nnot have access to the root level of your server, you may place a\r\nrobots.txt file at the same level as the files you want to remove. Doing\r\nthis and submitting via the automatic URL removal system will cause a\r\ntemporary, 180 day removal of your site from the Google index,\r\nregardless of whether you remove the robots.txt file after processing\r\nyour request. (Keeping the robots.txt file at the same level would\r\nrequire you to return to the URL removal system every 180 days to\r\nreissue the removal.)\r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove part of your website        \r\nOption 1: Robots.txt\r\nTo remove directories or individual pages of your website, you can place\r\na robots.txt file at the root of your server. For information on how to\r\ncreate a robots.txt file, see the The Robot Exclusion Standard\r\n<http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#robotstxt> . When creating\r\nyour robots.txt file, please keep the following in mind: When deciding\r\nwhich pages to crawl on a particular host, Googlebot will obey the first\r\nrecord in the robots.txt file with a User-agent starting with\r\n\"Googlebot.\" If no such entry exists, it will obey the first entry with\r\na User-agent of \"*\". Additionally, Google has introduced increased\r\nflexibility to the robots.txt file standard through the use asterisks.\r\nDisallow patterns may include \"*\" to match any sequence of characters,\r\nand patterns may end in \"$\" to indicate the end of a name.\r\nTo remove all pages under a particular directory (for example, lemurs),\r\nyou'd use the following robots.txt entry:\r\nUser-agent: Googlebot\r\nDisallow: /lemurs \r\nTo remove all files of a specific file type (for example, .gif), you'd\r\nuse the following robots.txt entry: \r\nUser-agent: Googlebot\r\nDisallow: /*.gif$ \r\nTo remove dynamically generated pages, you'd use this robots.txt entry:\r\nUser-agent: Googlebot\r\nDisallow: /*? \r\nOption 2: Meta tags\r\nAnother standard, which can be more convenient for page-by-page use,\r\ninvolves adding a <META> tag to an HTML page to tell robots not to index\r\nthe page. This standard is described at\r\nhttp://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#meta. \r\nTo prevent all robots from indexing a page on your site, you'd place the\r\nfollowing meta tag into the <HEAD> section of your page: \r\n<META NAME=\"ROBOTS\" CONTENT=\"NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW\">\r\nTo allow other robots to index the page on your site, preventing only\r\nGoogle's robots from indexing the page, you'd use the following tag: \r\n<META NAME=\"GOOGLEBOT\" CONTENT=\"NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW\">\r\nTo allow robots to index the page on your site but instruct them not to\r\nfollow outgoing links, you'd use the following tag: \r\n<META NAME=\"ROBOTS\" CONTENT=\"NOFOLLOW\">\r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . In order for this\r\nautomated process to work, the webmaster must first insert the\r\nappropriate meta tags into the page's HTML code. Doing this and\r\nsubmitting via the automatic URL removal system will cause a temporary,\r\n180-day removal of these pages from the Google index, regardless of\r\nwhether you remove the robots.txt file or meta tags after processing\r\nyour request.         \r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove snippets        \r\nA snippet is a text excerpt that appears below a page's title in our\r\nsearch results and describes the content of the page..\r\n\r\nTo prevent Google from displaying snippets for your page, place this tag\r\nin the <HEAD> section of your page: \r\n<META NAME=\"GOOGLEBOT\" CONTENT=\"NOSNIPPET\"> \r\nNote: removing snippets also removes cached pages.\r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . In order for this\r\nautomated process to work, the webmaster must first insert the\r\nappropriate meta tags into the page's HTML code.         \r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove cached pages        \r\nGoogle automatically takes a \"snapshot\" of each page it crawls and\r\narchives it. This \"cached\" version allows a webpage to be retrieved for\r\nyour end users if the original page is ever unavailable (due to\r\ntemporary failure of the page's web server). The cached page appears to\r\nusers exactly as it looked when Google last crawled it, and we display a\r\nmessage at the top of the page to indicate that it's a cached version.\r\nUsers can access the cached version by choosing the \"Cached\" link on the\r\nsearch results page.\r\nTo prevent all search engines from showing a \"Cached\" link for your\r\nsite, place this tag in the <HEAD> section of your page:: \r\n<META NAME=\"ROBOTS\" CONTENT=\"NOARCHIVE\"> \r\nTo allow other search engines to show a \"Cached\" link, preventing only\r\nGoogle from displaying one, use the following tag: \r\n<META NAME=\"GOOGLEBOT\" CONTENT=\"NOARCHIVE\"> \r\nNote: this tag only removes the \"Cached\" link for the page. Google will\r\ncontinue to index the page and display a snippet. \r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . In order for this\r\nautomated process to work, the webmaster must first insert the\r\nappropriate meta tags into the page's HTML code.         \r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove an outdated (\"dead\") link        \r\nGoogle updates its entire index automatically on a regular basis. When\r\nwe crawl the web, we find new pages, discard dead links, and update\r\nlinks automatically. Links that are outdated now will most likely \"fade\r\nout\" of our index during our next crawl. \r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . We'll accept your\r\nremoval request only if the page returns a true 404 error via the http\r\nheaders. Please ensure that you return a true 404 error even if you\r\nchoose to display a more user-friendly body of the HTML page for your\r\nvisitors. It won't help to return a page that says \"File Not Found\" if\r\nthe http headers still return a status code of 200, or normal.        \r\n\r\n        \r\n Remove an image from Google's Image Search        \r\nTo remove an image from Google's image index, add a robots.txt file to\r\nthe root of the server. (If you can't put it in the server root, you can\r\nput it at directory level.)\r\nExample: If you want Google to exclude the dogs.jpg image that appears\r\non your site at www.yoursite.com/images/dogs.jpg, create a page at\r\nwww.yoursite.com/robots.txt and add the following text: \r\nUser-agent: Googlebot-Image\r\nDisallow: /images/dogs.jpg \r\nTo remove all the images on your site from our index, place the\r\nfollowing robots.txt file in your server root:\r\nUser-agent: Googlebot-Image\r\nDisallow: / \r\nThis is the standard protocol that most web crawlers observe for\r\nexcluding a web server or directory from an index. More information on\r\nrobots.txt is available here: http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html.\r\nAdditionally, Google has introduced increased flexibility to the\r\nrobots.txt file standard through the use asterisks. Disallow patterns\r\nmay include \"*\" to match any sequence of characters, and patterns may\r\nend in \"$\" to indicate the end of a name. To remove all files of a\r\nspecific file type (for example, to include .jpg but not .gif images),\r\nyou'd use the following robots.txt entry: \r\nUser-agent: Googlebot-Image\r\nDisallow: /*.gif$ \r\n\r\n\r\nNote: If you believe your request is urgent and cannot wait until the\r\nnext time Google crawls your site, use our automatic URL removal system\r\n<http://services.google.com/urlconsole/controller> . In order for this\r\nautomated process to work, the webmaster must first create and place a\r\nrobots.txt file on the site in question. \r\nGoogle will continue to exclude your site or directories from successive\r\ncrawls if the robots.txt file exists in the web server root. If you do\r\nnot have access to the root level of your server, you may place a\r\nrobots.txt file at the same level as the files you want to remove. Doing\r\nthis and submitting via the automatic URL removal system will cause a\r\ntemporary, 180 day removal of the directories specified in your\r\nrobots.txt file from the Google index, regardless of whether you remove\r\nthe robots.txt file after processing your request. (Keeping the\r\nrobots.txt file at the same level would require you to return to the URL\r\nremoval system every 180 days to reissue the removal.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                The Planet Legal Response Team\r\n<LegalResponse@theplanet.com> wrote: \r\n\r\n                        We are unable to locate on the web page\r\n        \r\nhttp://www.mugshots.com/IMAGES/Mugshot__PATRICK-JAMES-EGAN.jpg any of\r\n                        the material that you claim is being infringed\r\nas of 10:54 AM --600\r\n                        (Central Standard Time), Friday, December 08\r\n2006.
