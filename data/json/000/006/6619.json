It originally appeared on their website at:\r\nwww.studenttraveler.com/mag/02-05/guatemala.php\r\n\r\nRecently, I discovered www.copyscape.com and did a search and discovered that www.eslusa.org had stolen my article and was using it without payment or permission.\r\n\r\nAs well, by doing a Google search query using: Guatemalan guinea pig language school. I found this site listed after the Student Traveler (non-offending) site. www.eslusa.org/General/NewsLetter/newsletter_0505.asp - 67k - 6 Jun2005\r\n\r\nSorry, but I was unable to ascertain the Message ID you require.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, by its agent or the law.
