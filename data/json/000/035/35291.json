Our concern is that\r\nstaff member and people we work with are listed there. \r\n \r\n        http://www.groupring.com \r\n        http://www.diff-eq.com \r\n \r\nI found some information of their ISPs: \r\n\"groupring.com\" is hosted by \"Neureal\", http://www.neureal.com/\r\n\"diff-eq.com\" is hosted by \"ThePlanet\", https://www.theplanet.com/ \r\n \r\nBoth planet and neureal are reseller under \"Everyones Internet \" in\r\nTexas USA. Their whois information is not very useful, as they are\r\n\"protected\" \r\nby something called \"Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc.\" \r\n \r\neg\r\nhttp://whois.domaintools.com/diff-eq.com\r\nhttp://whois.domaintools.com/groupring.com \r\n \r\nI imagine the same company/person stole the content, do a cut&paste job\r\nto create these sites, these submit them to various web directories. Any\r\nrecommendation on what to do next? \r\n \r\nVincent \r\n \r\nVincent Chung * IT Manager\r\n373-7599 ex 85759 * Mathematics Rm.306 \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-10-30T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-10-30T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"NZIMA","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
