It has come to the attention of my client that your company is infringing on the rights of my client in and to her registered mark \"TWC\" which is owned by LMD.\r\n\r\nThe legal test as to whether or not infringement has occurred is based upon the likelihood of confusion in the marketplace. Because you are in the same business and market to the same clientele, and because your use of \"TWC\" has caused confusion in the marketplace, you are infringing on my client's rights in and to her trademark.\r\n\r\nMy client has stated that she will pursue all legal means necessary to protect the trademark. She has suffered damages because of your infringement, especially your use of the mark on the internet. Under the law, she will be able to receive up to three times the damages you have caused, plus attorney's fees and costs. I am hopeful this situation will not escalate to that point. TWC and LMD have demanded that you cease and desist all futher use of the mark \"TWC\" or any other name which would cause confusion with my client's business.\r\n\r\nPlease acknowledge in writing your agreement to cease and desist and the date on which you will last use the mark. This should, in any event, not be more that thirty (30) days from the date of this letter.  \r\n\r\nShould you have questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact me.\r\n\r\nThank you, in advance, for your consideration.\r\n\r\nI Remain,\r\nSincerely,\r\n[private]","date_sent":"2004-06-03T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-06-03T04:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":"The Law Offices of Shannon K.
