The second photo shows me with shorter blonde hair looking slightly upwards in a professional work suit. These photos have been taken from my chambers website and my private Facebook album. Please note: I move to a new chambers this month, therefore the authorised link to the photo will soon be permanently removed very soon.\r\n\r\nThe second photo was in my private Facebook album, which has now been deleted completely. You can see from the other photo that notwithstanding the hair colour difference, it is the same person, i.e. me, Stephanie Varle. The photo was taken by my mum on my camera outside Lincoln's Inn on my call night. I own the copyright to this photo and have not authorised this awful site to publish it.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.jerk.be/Stephanie-Varle-p50669652.html"},{"url":"http://www.jerk.com/Stephanie-Varle-p50669652.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.kenworthysbarristers.co.uk/view_main_barrister.php?id=69"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
