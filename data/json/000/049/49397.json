I already asked him to remove the same \n\nimage off the same event advertised on facebook. I also have in my  \npossession copies of the conversation on his facebook event where he  \nacknowledges that he is in breach of my copyright, also he was extremely  \nabusive towards me at the time. Because he also made slurs on my financial\n \nstatus and also made other threats that he would make me suffer for asking\n \nhim to remove my artwork i removed the conversation off his event on  \nfacebook, after making copies, when he finally removed the image. The fact\n \nthat he has already removed the image off facebook confirms that he is in \n\nbreach of my copyright. Facebook takes copyright infringement seriously\nand  \nhe knows this. I can furnish facebook files with the conversation content \n\nand the same infringed copyright included if requested by google to\nsatisfy  \ngoogle that he is knowingly in breach of my copyright on google. That he  \nhas reposted the same image in connection with the same advertising on  \ngoogle just shows that he is knowingly breaching my copyright again, this \n\ntime it is obvious that he intends to disrespect my wishes and my rights  \neven further. Therefore I request that this image is removed off google  \nimmediately.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"https://plus.google.com/111311277072847710065/posts"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
