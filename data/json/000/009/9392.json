They  \nrecognize the critical dependence of many business processes on IT, the  \nneed to comply with increasing regulatory compliance demands and the  \nbenefits of managing risk effectively. To aid organizations in successfully  \nmeeting today\u2019s business challenges, the IT Governance Institute\u00ae (ITGI)  \nhas published version COBIT\u00ae 4.1.\nCOBIT is an IT governance framework and supporting toolset that allows  \nmanagers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues  \nand business risks. COBIT enables clear policy development and good  \npractice for IT control throughout organizations. COBIT emphasizes  \nregulatory compliance, helps organizations to increase the value attained  \nfrom IT, enables alignment and simplifies implementation of the COBIT  \nframework.\nCOBIT 4.1 can be used to enhance work already done based upon earlier  \nversions; it does not invalidate that previous work. When major activities  \nare planned for IT governance initiatives, or when an overhaul of the  \nenterprise control framework is anticipated, it is recommended to start  \nfresh with the most recent version of COBIT.\"","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/COBIT/Pages/Overview.aspx"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
