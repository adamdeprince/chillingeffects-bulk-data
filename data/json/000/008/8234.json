Rolls-Royce has a long, glorious history of experimental cars. The first one from the renowned house was a 1919 Silver Ghost test bed, chassis number 1EX, and the latest is the 102EX, a battery-electric version of the current Phantom. The 10EX, which is up for grabs, is one of the most significant Rolls-Royce experimental cars and was built in late 1925.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://carsbitblogsport.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"},{"url":"http://recingcarspotblogs.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"},{"url":"http://topgearnew.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"},{"url":"http://livingproper.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports-tourer-10ex-up-for-grabs/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.bornrich.com/entry/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports-tourer-10ex-up-for-grabs/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
