There's certainly more, but it would take me several days to\r\nfind all of it. They're fairly graphic, however.\r\nThe images were originally put up by a user, but the site owners claimed to\r\nhave deleted them when they didn't. I only found the first by accident.\r\nI realise that it is against The Planet's TOS for a site they host to have\r\nany images that go against applicable obscenity laws, and since in this case\r\nit would be a federal violation, I decided to report it.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n- -S.
