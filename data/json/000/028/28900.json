{"dmca":{"id":28900,"type":"Dmca","title":"My Owl Photo","body":"Unfortunately, my copyright stamp was removed from my image. However you can clearly\r\nsee it on the original:\r\nhttp://www.animalpicturesarchive.com/view.php?tid=1&did=142307\r\n\r\nThis is really a simple matter. I want the person /company to either pay me $500.00\r\nfor using my image that they are selling on shirts or remove my image from their\r\nwebsites (hosted by your company). If this is not done within a reasonable time, I\r\nwill be forced to escalate matters.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJohn White\r\n  ----- Original Message ----- \r\n  From: Legal Response \r\n  To: john.white161@verizon.net \r\n  Cc: Theplanet@chillingeffects.org \r\n  Sent: Monday, March 27, 2006 10:24 AM\r\n  Subject: FW: My Owl Photo\r\n\r\n\r\n  To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  Please note that below-referenced copyright infringement notice does not\r\nsubstantially comply with the required notification elements of the Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act of 1998 (\"DMCA\").\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  Please note that we have not passed on the substantive merits of your claim.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  Please visit our web site at www.theplanet.com/legal.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n  Legal Response Team\r\n\r\n  THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  From: John White [mailto:john.white161@verizon.net] \r\n  Sent: Sunday, March 26, 2006 3:15 PM\r\n  To: admin@crazytees.com\r\n  Cc: copyright@theplanet.com; abuse@theplanet.com; legal-response@theplanet.com\r\n  Subject: My Owl Photo\r\n\r\n\r\n  You are using my snowy owl (O RLY) photo without my permission.\r\n(http://www.crazytees.com/home.php) If you would like to continue using my photo\r\nit will cost you $500.\r\n\r\n  Best Regards,\r\n\r\n  John White\r\n\r\n  ______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n  Registrant:\r\n  CrazyTees.com\r\n  8864 S.
