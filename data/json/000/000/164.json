They will\r\nalso enhance the on-line experience in that they will further educate and\r\nhonor those military units that you represent in your game.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your attention to this matter.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2002-02-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-02-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"[Private]","recipient_name":"Day of Defeat Development Team","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
