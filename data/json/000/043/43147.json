After implementing some re write rules into my .htaccess I was able to\r\neffectively block the use of the images as had been going on. \r\nNow they've come and grabbed the images right off the site and placed them\r\non your server.\r\n\r\nBandwidth theft is a crime, Image theft is a crime. \r\nThere are criminals on your server.\r\n\r\nI would like these images removed from your server immediately.\r\nThe list of images.\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/forum_new.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/forum_old.gif \r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/thread%20on%20new.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/thread_hot_new.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/thread_hot.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/poll_new.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/thread%20on%20new.gif\r\nhttp://4.forumer.com/html/emoticons/grannysplace/thread_lock.gif\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt assistance with this.\r\n\r\nChuck Wadlow\r\nhttp://infoprosjoint.net","date_sent":"2004-09-23T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-09-23T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"http://infoprosjoint.net","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
