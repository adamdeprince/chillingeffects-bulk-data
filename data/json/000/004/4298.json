We also do not make use of any  \nofficially trademarked logos within our application. In the market  \ndescriptions, we do reference these trademarked names. We do this to help  \nthe buyer identify that the app is convenient and helpful to the fans of  \nthese teams. The second time we use it is to clearly state that we are not  \naffiliated. We do this because we do not want to confuse the buyer. We do  \nnot use the logo as an official app would. We do not say we are official.  \nActually we state the fact that we are not affiliated, and we name the  \norganization by trademark, to validate that we are clearly not associated  \nwith them. Inside the app we do not use their trademarked name at all. Our  \napp is convenient way for a user to quickly link to websites and other  \ncontent that might interest a fan of these teams. We are not in competition  \nwith their official apps, if they even have one, nor are we trying  \nto \"confuse\" the customer into thinking we are. We would actually be open  \nto any suggestions that would allow us to continue to satisfy our  \ncustomers, while also ensuring no legal issues. Most of our content is  \ncontent that cannot be found on the official websites, or news that the is  \nnot provided by the official sources. We have plans to add a chat mechanism  \nto allow these \"people of a similar interest\", aka fans, to be able to post  \nmessages and pictures with other users. This is yet another item that is  \nnot an option on the official application or resources provided to their  \nfans. I would like to clarify this point: If this is not legal, then I  \ndon't want anything to do with it. I am an extremely hard working  \nprogrammer that has dedicated 1000's of hours to getting my apps out on the  \nappmarket, and I want to make money fair and square, period. So I don't  \nwant to pursue improving my apps if they are just going to be taken off the  \nmarket as soon as some organization feels that my 3 sales a week @1.49 is  \nsomehow hurting their market and profits. If my phrasing in my descriptions  \nneeds to be changed, I will do that. If my use of part of the trademarked  \nphrase is in violation, I will change the name. I can not make it clear  \nenough that I do not want to make a profit off of some else's hard work,  \nand I have not. I have earned this money by providing for fans of these  \norganizations what they cannot themselves provide. These organizations only  \npublish \"Happy News\". Their fans want ALL news available. I have even seen  \ncomments reflecting that these official apps, \"Only provided the same  \ncontent as their website\". This is insulting to the fans, they deserve  \nbetter. I would like to be official, maybe someone can redirect me to whom  \nI shall contact, but if I am not aloud to show 3rd party (unofficial) news,  \nI would not be interested, as this is why I created these apps. I noticed  \nthat I am going to check a box below that states: \"or that the material  \nidentified by the complainant has been removed or disabled and will no  \nlonger be shown.\" If for some reason it is decided that my apps are indeed  \nin violation, I would like an opportunity to have them unpublished so I can  \nremoved the content that is in violation and republish the app. Thank you  \nso much for taking the time to help me with this.\ndmca_consent_statement: checked\ndmca_consent_statementtwo: checked\ndmca_signature: Reshat Hasankolli II\ndmca_signature_date_day: 27\ndmca_signature_date_month: 06\ndmca_signature_date_year: 2011\nform: dmca_counter\nfull_name: Reshat Hasankolli II\nhidden_product: androidmarket\norigin: helpcenter\nphone: 203-755-4743\nyour_title:\n","date_sent":"2011-06-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2011-06-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
