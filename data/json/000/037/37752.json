Now, thanks to the internet, you can find information on virtually anything you want, instantly. Something which was only a dream just 10 years ago.\r\n\r\nYet with all this information available to us, people still fail to become successful in life. Why is this? After all, there is so much self help information available telling us how to be successful, but most people still fail to achieve success. And why do people still suffer from depression, when there are so many books telling them how to live a great life?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, information is not the problem. And no matter how much technology advances, people will always have the same problems.\r\n\r\nWhat Are The Reasons People Fail To Achieve Success?\r\n\r\nIf you ask someone why they never succeeded in what they were trying to do, they will most likely tell you it was someone else\u2019s fault, or something happened that was beyond their control. However if you compare that persons life against someone else\u2019s life, you could probably find many examples of people who suffered under far worse conditions yet still became a success.\r\n\r\nThis shows us that the real reason people fail is not because of something outside of them, rather the reason lies within.\r\n\r\nInternal Reasons For Failure\r\n\r\nWhen you continue to do the same thing over and over again it is called a habit. You are probably familiar with bad habits such as smoking, but are you familiar with the habits of failure or the habits of success?\r\n\r\nCreating Habits Of Success\r\n\r\nSince success or failure is ultimately achieved through the actions you take, habits therefore play a tremendous role in determining whether you will achieve success or failure in life. For example. If you read everyday, that is a habit. This habit is likely to expand your knowledge of a subject, and vastly improve the chances you will master and be successful at it.\r\n\r\nHowever, let\u2019s say that instead of reading everyday, you prefer to sit down and watch TV for a few hours. Do you think this will help you master any subject? Or become an expert in your field? In all likelihood, the answer will be no.\r\n\r\nSo if you look at achieving success or failure in terms of the actions you repeat on a daily basis, then it is quite simple to understand why some people succeed, and others complain of failure. People who are successful continually do things on a daily basis that will increase their chances of success. Whilst unsuccessful people do not.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean successful people never fail, they do. But what they don\u2019t do is give up, because they have developed habits of success.\r\n\r\nChange Your Habits!\r\n\r\nThe message you should take away from this article is that in order to experience change in your life you must first identify your habits. Think about what do you do on a daily basis, and ask yourself if those things help you achieve what you want in life?\r\n\r\nIf the answer is no, you must then change those habits, because by doing the same thing over and over again you will only get the same results over and over again.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://alien618.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://article-dashboard.com/article.php?id=613&act=print"},{"url":"http://article-dashboard.com/ezineready.php?id=613"},{"url":"http://articleshubsite.com/293480/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://articlestreets.com/self-improvement/success/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://best-medicaresupplement.com/bms/Display.cfm/9940"},{"url":"http://better-health.article-dynamics.com/publish/?id=338930"},{"url":"http://breakingbadvideobb711.tumblr.com/"},{"url":"http://breakingbadvideobb738.tumblr.com/"},{"url":"http://breakingbadweb.com/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://butts681.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://capp707.typepad.com/"},{"url":"http://capp707.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://carnivorous114.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://changeyourlifepraxis.com/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://creatingyourvelocity.com/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://egeus2651.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://enjoyselfimprovement.com/breaking_bad_habits_of_failure/"},{"url":"http://freecl.com/-breaking-bad-habits-of-failure-a77349.htm"},{"url":"http://greenelf897.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://hypnotictunes.com/articles/Breaking_Bad_Habits_Of_Failure.html"},{"url":"http://igaveupsmoking.com/tag/reason-folks"},{"url":"http://kelpie569.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://leadabetterlife.com/2010/11/27/breaking-free-from-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://macbeth3751.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://microsoftoffices.blinkweb.com/user_sites/sub_wa/watchbreakingbadfree793/1/2011/10/"},{"url":"http://mikeerwinonline.com/Blog/success/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://newaquaponics.com/aqua/Display.cfm/9940"},{"url":"http://obikenobi789.typepad.com/"},{"url":"http://obikenobi789.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://plrplr.com/11742/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/20836509/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/21166825/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/21464306/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/21732533/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/22108288/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://quizilla.teennick.com/stories/22274328/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure"},{"url":"http://rosencrantz98.typepad.com/"},{"url":"http://rosencrantz98.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://shadetree411.com/self-improvementsuccess/breaking_bad_habits_of_failure.html"},{"url":"http://sicinius573.typepad.com/"},{"url":"http://sicinius573.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://starwars150.typepad.com/blog/2011/08/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://success.iknownow.net/info/Breaking-Bad-Habits-Of-Failure/493355.html"},{"url":"http://uberant.com/article/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://urukhai140.typepad.com/blog/2011/09/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://vinrows.com/wine/Display.cfm/9940"},{"url":"http://watchbreakingbadonline824.tumblr.com/"},{"url":"http://www.articleexclusive.com/article/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure-90873-1.html"},{"url":"http://www.articlenorth.com/ezineready.php?id=67774"},{"url":"http://www.economyinternetdomains.biz/aussiearticles/articledetail.php?artid=20015&catid=176&title=Breaking+Bad+Habits+Of+Failure"},{"url":"http://www.eugeneg.com/blog/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://www.eugeneg.com/blog/tag/bad-habits/"},{"url":"http://www.eugeneg.com/blog/tag/failure/"},{"url":"http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474980047972"},{"url":"http://www.hiddenhabits.com/breaking-bad-habits-failure/"},{"url":"http://www.hrpk.com/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Breaking-Bad-Habits-Failure-4036072.S.86514145"},{"url":"http://www.maxdsilva.com/4/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://www.newscube.net/self/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure/"},{"url":"http://www.notepad.in/article.php?id=27164&act=print"},{"url":"http://www.quickreadabout.com/details/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://www.streetdirectory.com/etoday/breaking-dogs-bad-habits-efajp.html"},{"url":"http://www.tacopalypse.com/Self_Improvement/Success/breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"http://www.yashveer.com/self-improvement/25351-breaking-bad-habits-of-failure.html"},{"url":"
