The website states: \"21st Century Eminis\n \nis what I would say another scam from the Jamie McIntyre Scams long list.\nI  \nmust also say that I didn't know how bad this guy was and how many other  \nbusinesses he's marketing and consequently scamming people.\"\n\nThe site suggests that 21st Century Academy is running, and has run a long\n \nlist of scams that they are currently marketing to people.\n\nb.            21st Century Academy is not a \"scam company\". I have never  \noperated a scam. I have not been charged, arrested, or convicted of any  \ndishonesty offence. I would not be involved with any offences of this  \nnature.\n\nThis is a comment designed to harm my business, a small company employing \n\nless than 10 people.\n\nc.
