Chief Operating Officer\r\n\r\nRE: ROLEX WATCH U.S.A., INC.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Crosby:\r\n\r\n        This firm is general counsel to Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. (\"Rolex\"),\r\nthe owners of the federally registered Rolex Trademarks: ROLEX, PRESIDENT,\r\nSUBMARINER, YACHT-MASTER, DAYTONA, GMT-MASTER, DATEJUST and Crown Device\r\n(among others).\r\n\r\n        We are writing to request your assistance with the following web\r\nsites hosted by your service that are selling counterfeit Rolex products.\r\nThe www.bluefakes.com, www.exclusivereplicas.com, www.fineluxurytime.com\r\nwww.goswissreplica.com, and www.upscalereplica.com websites offer\r\ncounterfeit and infringing Rolex watches for sale.  Such illegal use of the\r\nRolex Trademarks is likely to cause confusion and constitutes\r\ncounterfeiting, trademark infringement and dilution of Rolex's intellectual\r\nproperty rights in violation of both federal and state laws.  This is also\r\nin violation with ThePlanet.com's acceptable use policy, which states:\r\n\r\n\"Transmission, distribution, or storage of any information, data or material\r\nin violation of United States or state regulation or law, or by the common\r\nlaw, is prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, material protected\r\nby copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property\r\nrights\"(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n        As a result, we ask your voluntary assistance in removing these\r\nwebsites, or requiring that the owners of these sites cease offering\r\ncounterfeit Rolex merchandise for sale.  As you may be aware, as the ISP for\r\nthese sites, ThePlanet.com may be held liable for contributory trademark\r\ncounterfeiting and infringement if, upon notice, you do not take action to\r\nprevent the activity.  The penalties for such conduct are severe and may\r\ninclude injunctive relief, actual damages, statutory damages of up to\r\n$1,000,000 for each trademark that has been counterfeited, costs and\r\nattorneys' fees. \r\n\r\n        In addition, as an ICANN accredited Registrar, you are required\r\nunder subsection 3.7.8 of ICANN's Registrar Accreditation Agreement (\"RAA\")\r\nto take reasonable steps to investigate and correct any inaccuracy in the\r\ncontact information of the Registrants associated with www.bluefakes.com,\r\nwww.exclusivereplicas.com, www.fineluxurytime.com, www.goswissreplica.com,\r\nand www.upscalereplica.com. This letter serves as notice that the\r\nRegistrants' contact information for www.bluefakes.com,\r\nwww.exclusivereplicas.com, www.fineluxurytime.com, www.goswissreplica.com,\r\nand www.upscalereplica.com is inaccurate. \r\n\r\n        This letter also serves as notice regarding the illegal activities\r\nof the above-referenced websites.  Your continued hosting of these sites\r\nwithout ensuring that they have ceased the sale of counterfeit merchandise\r\nis henceforth done with knowledge and, therefore, may constitute willful\r\ncontributory counterfeiting and trademark infringement.\r\n\r\n        It is our desire to avoid legal proceedings against your service. We\r\ntherefore request that you provide us with the accurate contact information\r\nfor the Registrants associated with\r\nwww.bluefakes.com, www.exclusivereplicas.com, www.fineluxurytime.com,\r\nwww.goswissreplica.com, and    www.upscalereplica.com, in accordance with\r\nSubsection 3.7.8 of the RAA.  We request this information, along with your\r\nwritten assurance that you have either removed the offending web pages or\r\nrequired the websites' owners to remove the illegal content from their\r\nsites, before November 26, 2004.\r\n\r\n        We thank you in advance for your cooperation and we await a response\r\nfrom you or your counsel.\r\n\r\n                                                        Sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                        Gibney, Anthony &\r\nFlaherty, LLP\r\n\r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nBy:__________________________\r\n                                                                John\r\nMacaluso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ns:/Internetgroup/00601/C&D/bluefakes-exclusivereplicas-goswissreplica-upscal\r\nereplica.doc\r\n\r\nThis message is intended only for the use of the individual or entity to\r\nwhich it is addressed, and may contain information that is privileged\r\nconfidential and exempt from disclosure under applicable law.
