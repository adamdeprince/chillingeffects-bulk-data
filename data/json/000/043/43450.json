The site is now back online running the same illegal\r\nscripts.\r\n\r\nTo help verify the copyright, you will find my email address\r\n(ian@designbyian.com) in the source code of the copied scripts (if it has\r\nnot been removed by the time you read this). Please do not share this\r\ninformation with the website owner as it would facilitate future piracy.\r\n\r\nThe scripts will probably be located in the cgi-bin directory but could also\r\nbe located in root public_html or a sub directory of cgi-bin. The first\r\nscript to look for would be sf.cgi. Some of the pirated scripts will also\r\nprobably be located in an additional sub directory called /include.\r\n\r\nHere is a partial list of scripts that, if found, are definitely pirated:\r\nsf.cgi, clickstats.cgi, searchstats.cgi, proxyguard.cgi, earnings.cgi,\r\nmemclicks.cgi, cntryadmin.cgi, confirm.cgi, countrystats.cgi, xmltweak.cgi,\r\npglive.cgi, inactive.cgi, backup.cgi, feedme.cgi, menume.cgi, miscme.cgi.\r\n\r\nIt is also likely that the base search engine script powering this site is\r\nan illegal copy of scripts owned by SmarterScripts.com. These scripts will\r\ncontain code modifications copyrighted by me. This is in addition to the\r\ncomplete scripts mentioned above. Base scripts that probably contain pirated\r\ncode modifications:\r\nsmartsearch.cgi, include.cgi, accounts.cgi, crawl.cgi, admin_misc.cgi,\r\nfunctions.cgi, search.cgi and a variety of others.\r\n\r\nI affirm that I am the sole owner of the copyrighted material in question\r\nand that all information contained herein is true and correct. I have\r\nattached a digital scan of my signature.\r\n\r\nI am requesting immediate removal. Please reply to confirm that the illegal\r\nmaterial is no longer online.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nIan Kelley\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\nIan Kelley - Web Design and Programming\r\nEnding world hunger through clever UI implementation.\r\n\r\nOver ten years experience with HTML, web graphics, SEO and user interface\r\n(UI) design.
