Each menu is designed to  \nprovide a wide variety of nutritious foods that are different in color,  \nshape, size and texture. All of our child care menus include foods that\nare  \nnew or different, the children's favorites, culturally diverse, and  \nseasonally appropriate. Menus are rotated on a six-week basis to provide  \n\nthe children with a balance of variety and familiarity. Menus are adapted \n\nto incorporate fresh in-season produce and special foods that fit our  \ncurrent curriculum.
