First, the Festival Board wants to thank you for all of the time and energy you have devoted to maintence of the www.hopkinsraspberryfestival.com website on behalf of the Festival. Your past commitment and donations are greatly appreciated.\r\n         \r\nHowever, after much discussion, the Festival Board has determined that all future maintenance and control of the website will be managed directly by the Festival Board. The Festival Board feels this action is necessary to ensure the continuity and control it is required to exercise over  the official website for  the Festival.\r\n         \r\nAs a result of this decision, you no longer have the authority to operate and maintain the website on behalf of the Festival or to use the Festival","date_sent":"2004-11-23T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-11-23T05:00:00Z","topics":["Domain Names and Trademarks","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Hopkins Raspberry Festival","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
