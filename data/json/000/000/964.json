{"dmca":{"id":964,"type":"Dmca","title":"Barbie's Got A Gun?","body":"Dear Sir:\r\n\r\nWe are attorneys for Mattel, Inc.\r\n\r\nAs you probably know, Mattel is one of the world's largest manufacturers of consumer products, including toys, games and dolls.  Mattel owns the trademark BARBIE, as well as numerous federal trademark registrations for that mark.  The BARBIE trademark has been used consistently since at least 1959.  In connection with that use, Mattel and its licensees have sold billions of dollars of merchandise.  BARBIE is therefore an extraordinarily valuable and famous trademark.\r\n\r\nWe are writing because Mattel has learned that you have registered the domain name \"barbiesgun.com\" and are using it to promote a band called \"Barbies Gun.\"  This use of BARBIE in the domain name, in the web site and in the name of the band infringes the BARBIE trademark in violation of 15 U.S.C.
