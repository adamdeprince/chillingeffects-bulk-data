I hold several patent on beadpens(www.beadpens.com).  I have had to file suit several times against one company for patent infringement, they are not licensed to sell my products.  Each time I dropped the suits because they quit selling. Now i just recently dropped the suit again, and they immediately began selling infringing products again.  If you review their site several weeks ago they stated that they would not longer be selling the infringing pens.  As a result I dropped the lawsuit,  Now I see that have begun the same infringing behavior again.  You can verify that I have several patents by searching the patent office at USPTO,gov  You can also contact my law firm to verify this info, Brent Sumner at Kayira law,3148722141","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.karenthomas.us/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.goodybeads.com"},{"url":"http://www.arrowsprings.com"},{"url":"http://www.artbeads.com"},{"url":"http://www.t-beads.com"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
