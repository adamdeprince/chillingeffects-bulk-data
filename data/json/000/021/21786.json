The best thing about the FlyNano single-seat fun flyer is that you don\u2019t even need to have a license to fly it. The FlyNano is made entirely of carbon fiber, weighs in at a mere 70kg and takes off and lands on water. Since the FlyNano falls under the weight of what is considered to be a plane, you don\u2019t have to worry of applying for a flying license in most parts of the world.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://arts-post.blogspot.com/2011/04/flynano-single-seat-aircraft-doesnt.html"},{"url":"http://carbuildingz.blogspot.com/2011/04/flynano-single-seat-aircraft-doesnt.html"},{"url":"http://carsbitblogsport.blogspot.com/2011/04/flynano-single-seat-aircraft-doesnt.html"},{"url":"http://livingproper.com/2011/04/flynano-single-seat-aircraft-doesn%E2%80%99t-need-you-to-have-a-flying-license/"},{"url":"http://ymnation.com/?p=7580"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.bornrich.com/entry/flynano-single-seat-aircraft-doesn-t-need-you-to-have-the-flying-license/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
