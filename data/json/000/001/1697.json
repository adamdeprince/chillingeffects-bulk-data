{"dmca":{"id":1697,"type":"Dmca","title":"clue-sticks and trademarks","body":"Hello.\r\n\r\nI found your web site, http://www.thereisnocat.com/showme216.html has a\r\nreference to a Clue-By-Four (tm).  Unfortunately, my company owns the\r\ntrademark to that term, and I am in the process of bringing that product to\r\nmarket.  My lawyers have told me that if you do not include a \"tm\" (trademark\r\nsymbol) on your reference, it dilutes my trademark.\r\n\r\nI would much rather ask you politely to remove references to Clue-by-Four(tm)\r\nor include the \"(tm) -- trademark\" than have an ugly lawyerese letter sent\r\nvia certified mail, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n\r\n[Private]\r\nPresident, Intrax, Inc.","date_sent":"2003-06-19T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-06-19T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Intrax, Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
