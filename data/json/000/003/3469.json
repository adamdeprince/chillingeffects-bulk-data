{"dmca":{"id":3469,"type":"Dmca","title":"iconsurf.com","body":"I'm sure you get enough hate mail regarding your iconsurf.com site links, so\r\nI'll make this brief.\r\n\r\nSince you are using my (copyrighted) icon on a site which solicits advertisment\r\nincome, you are violating the law.  I'm sure you don't intend to be sued, and I\r\nunderstand it can be easy to make mistakes.  In the interest of being\r\nforgiving, friendly, and helpful, I'll wait a week for you to stop using\r\ncopyrighted material on your site.  If after that time, you choose to continue\r\nviolating the law, I will need to take other actions including, but not limited\r\nto, seeking legal action against you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nPaul Ericksen\r\n\r\nP.S.  Just to avoid your next, likely yet unexceptable response, let me\r\npreemptively say that I've noticed on your site a statement assuring that\r\nwebmasters who didn't want their icons to be listed on your site could request\r\ntheir image to be removed.  After you have used someone's copyrighted material\r\nfor you financial gain, the law has already been broken.  There would be no\r\nneed to ask for my icon's removal if you are not breaking the law.  Removing my\r\nicon would not stop you from continuing the crime you commit with every hit on\r\nyour site.  Just stop posting any icon you don't have permission to use, and\r\nyou should be a-ok.","date_sent":"2004-06-26T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-06-26T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Linking"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Paul Ericksen","recipient_name":"Iconsurf.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
