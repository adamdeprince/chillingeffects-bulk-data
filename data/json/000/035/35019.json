Remember we emailed each\r\nother in the past before regarding illegal music file sharing. We at\r\nEasylife Records are 100% against piracy of music and do not like our music\r\nbeing shared anywhere.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed that desidhabaforums.com  is hosted with you guys.\r\nDesidhabaforums.com have been illegally sharing music on their website.\r\nYou need a log in user name and password, once you have entered it brings up\r\nmany pages of illegal pirated music. The music being shared is under major\r\nlabels such as Genie Records, Moviebox, Us - Easylife Records, Untouchables\r\nUk and many more other major labels.  I have attached some evidence of this\r\nfor you aswell. The actual address is\r\nhttp://www.desidhabaforums.com/cheetah/. The website is running under\r\nice-enterprises.com, which is hosted with theplanet.com.\r\n\r\nWe are under the BPI (British Phonographic Industury - who deal with piracy\r\nover the internet) and we are willing to take action against the owners of\r\nthis server/domain.\r\n\r\nWe would like action taken against this hosting/domain as soon as possible\r\nas it taking our music industury down.\r\n\r\nPlease check the attachment to show you evidence of this happening.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks in advance\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPrit Singh\r\n\r\nEasylife Records Limited\r\n( +44 (0)1926 745913\r\nemail: pritsingh@easyliferecords.com\r\nwebsite: www.easyliferecords.com\r\n\r\n*******************************************************\r\nNOTE: The information in this email is confidential and may be legally\r\nprivileged.
