Proliferation isn't a rose killer and it can avoided.\n\nThe reason for proliferation in garden roses is not fully understood. The \n\neffect is usually noticed when a rose bud tries to form within a flower  \nthat has already opened. Often, a stem with unfurling leaves could grow\nout  \nthrough the flower with the bud at the end of it. It's a freakish event\nfor  \nthe rose lover.\n\nProliferation in roses has been known for centuries. Botanists of the 18th\n \ncentury called these new buds \"childings,\" due to the symbolism of the  \nmutation.\nRose Virus\n\nSome rosarians believe it is a viral disease that occurs in only certain  \nvarieties of roses, but it has been known to happen in all rose types. Old\n \nor antique roses are particularly susceptible to rose proliferation.\n\nRose Genetic Mutation\n\nRosarians also believe it could be a genetic error or mutation in the  \nreproductive parts of the rose. Not all the flowers on the single rose  \nplant infected may be suffering from proliferation. It could only affect a\n \nfew or as many as 50% of the flowers.\nSpontaneous Rose Proliferation\n\nProliferation can be random. It can happen one year and not the next. This\n \nis thought to be a spontaneous genetic mutation as the flowers develop.  \nRose gardeners argue that proliferation in roses could be due to weather  \npatterns. Hence the randomness. Late frosts in spring after the rose is  \nbeginning to unfurl it's leaves and buds can result in proliferation.\n\nIn roses that only flower once in spring, this can be very disappointing\nto  \nthe gardener. But for roses with repeat-flowering habits, the second-flush\n \nof flowers is often free of proliferation.\nRose Choices to Avoid Proliferation\n\nWhile the reason for rose proliferation is still not known for certain, it\n \nis known that cold springs and too much nitrogen in the soil can cause  \nproblems with both the number of flowers as well as the health of the  \nflower.\n\nRose Genetic Mutation\n\nRosarians also believe it could be a genetic error or mutation in the  \nreproductive parts of the rose.
