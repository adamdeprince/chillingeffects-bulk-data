(RIAA) and its member record companies.\r\nThe RIAA is a trade association whose member companies create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute approximately ninety (90) percent of all\r\nlegitimate sound recordings sold in the United States.  Under penalty of\r\nperjury, we submit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its\r\nmember companies in matters involving the infringement of their sound\r\nrecordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights\r\non the Internet.   \r\n\r\n        We believe your service is hosting the above-referenced files on\r\nits network. These files offer unauthorized sound recordings for\r\ndownload by the artist known as Mika, which have not yet been\r\ncommercially released.  We have a good faith belief that the\r\nabove-described activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its\r\nagent, or the law.  We assert that the information in this notification\r\nis accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\n        We are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this\r\nunauthorized activity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the\r\ninfringing files from the system, or that you disable access to the\r\ninfringing files.\r\n\r\n        You should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you\r\nthat this site operator may be liable for the infringing activity\r\noccurring on your service.  In addition, under the Digital Millennium\r\nCopyright Act, if you ignore this notice, you and/or your company may\r\nalso be liable for any resulting infringement. This letter does not\r\nconstitute a waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue\r\nof any such unauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims\r\nfor other relief are expressly retained. \r\n\r\n        You may contact me at RIAA, 1025 F St, N.W., 10th Floor,\r\nWashington, D.C., 20004, Tel. (202) 775-0101, or e-mail \r\nantipiracy@riaa.com <mailto:antipiracy@riaa.com> , to discuss this\r\nnotice.  We await your response.
