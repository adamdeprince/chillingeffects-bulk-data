In the absence of such proof, your \ncompanies should not be aiding and abetting what appears to be massive \ncriminal copyright infringement. Visa should not be processing credit \ncards and financially benefiting from this apparent illegal activity, \nwebazilla should not be hosting such activity, and Google should not be \nlinking to and benefiting from the traffic it receives by helping users \nlocate stolen materials. Although I have not examined the links for \n\u201ccute young Lolita\u201d for obvious reasons, someone should also check to \nsee if the Google links to depositfiles.com which offer materials \nrelating to \u201ccute young lolita gets her pussy stretched.\u201d and \u201cAwesome \nwhore Jada Stevens got her mouth raped,\u201d lead to illegal materials.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[redacted], Ph.D.\n\n310-476-0700\n[redacted]\nBeverly Hills, CA 90212\n\n","date_sent":"2012-04-14T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2012-04-14T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Perfect 10, Inc.","recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
