She has got a bunch of emails posted on her site that were\r\nprivate between me and her to show everyone but the worse part is I have\r\nother websites in my signature that are being shown for other businesses\r\nthat had nothing to do with this and she is defaming innocent sites and is\r\nrefusing to take them down, I emailed her today and the companies have\r\nemailed her yet she still has them up. I believe this illegal and unethical\r\nto defame innoncent sites and asking for you to take her site off since she\r\nwill not comply.  She has also been using her tag board and putting my name\r\nand linking it to my site with fake tags to make it look like it was me\r\nposting the info. \r\n\r\nThank you for your Time,\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJennifer Magee\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n <http://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails.html>\r\nhttp://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails.html\r\n\r\n <http://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails2.html>\r\nhttp://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails2.html \r\n\r\n <http://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails3.html>\r\nhttp://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails3.html \r\n\r\n <http://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails4.html>\r\nhttp://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails4.html \r\n\r\n <http://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails5.html>\r\nhttp://www.diddledazzledesigns.com/emails5.html \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\nLineart from various\r\n<http://www.enchantedfairydreamz.com/mymemberships1.html> Memberships\r\n\r\nSome Tubes from  <http://www.tenderteddytags.com/> Tender Teddy Tags\r\n<http://www.lilave.com/> Lil Ave  ","date_sent":"2006-04-11T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-11T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Jennifer Magee","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
