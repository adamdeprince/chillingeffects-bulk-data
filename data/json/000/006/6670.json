A person by the name of [private], maintaining a blog using your services, was in receipt of an email of mine accidentally sent to him. He asked if he could post it on his blog. I explicitly refused him permission and he said that he would post it anyway, but without my name, and did so. Since then, I've asked him to remove the email and each time he has refused to take it down. The link is http://freelancerights.blogspot.com/2005/05/thoughtful-exchange-with-reader.html.\r\n\r\n2. The material appears toward the top of the page in two italicized paragraphs: \"Well, he's certainly right ... is inherently bad.\"\r\n\r\n3. My email address is [private] and my phone number is [private].\r\n\r\n4. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\n5.
