{"dmca":{"id":702,"type":"Dmca","title":"Infringment of product","body":"I recently discovered that your company has trademarked/copyrighted the phrase \"SYSTEM 10\". As you/your clients may not  be aware there is a product, made by me which has the phrase \"SYSTEM 10\" in its product. Babya System 10 is a shell replacment which is famous because of the many places where you can get it from. This version has been availabvle since April 2002, and it is a popular download. This product was released early last year and it is a successful application.  \r\n \r\nMy work is copyrighted under Australian ciopyright laws, and I personally value the importance of my product's identity and embarrsment to users/clents.\r\n\r\nCould you please reply, in a email addressed to babyap2002@yahoo.co.uk, how long have you used the words \"SYSTEM 10\" for and any copyrigyt guidelines that may be in place. I cannot afford a leghal case, as I'm [young].  \r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2002-07-20T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-07-20T04:00:00Z","topics":["Piracy or Copyright Infringement","Copyright"],"sender_name":"NA","principal_name":"Babya","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
