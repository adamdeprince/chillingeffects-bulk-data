While both second party audit and  \nthird party audit are external audits.\n  Organizations use first party (internal) audits to audit themselves for  \ninternal purposes. However, organizations don\u2019t have to do them their-self.  \nOrganizations can ask an external organization to carry out an internal  \naudit on behalf of organization. Organization can also use first party  \naudits to declare that organization complies with the QMS ISO 9001 standard  \n(a self-declaration).\n  Second party audits are external audits. They\u2019re usually done by customers  \nor by others on their behalf. However, they can also be done by any  \nexternal party that has an interest in your organization.\n  Third party audits are external audits as well. However, they\u2019re performed  \nby independent (disinterested) external organizations.\n  Third party audits are used to determine whether or not an organization  \ncomplies with the QMS ISO 9001 standard. Third party auditors are referred  \nto as registrars or certification bodies.\u201d","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://qms-guides.blogspot.com/2009/08/qms-iso-9001-audit-what-is-it.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
