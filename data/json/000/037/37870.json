I have another such Website that contains\r\nexactly the same article by Ms. Thomas, but that contains a different\r\nphrase.\r\n\r\nThe Website is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.best-internet-marketing-strategy.info/web-site-marketing-bc.htm\r\n\r\nThe phrase this time is \"website marketing bc\", though this is hardly an\r\nissue.  As I commented in my previous communication, this is unacceptable\r\nabuse of Ms. Thomas's work, and the article must be removed.  Please attend\r\nto this at your earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n- -Baruch Ben-David\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.1 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFDk3jbvK/XpJs6oyURAneXAJwKDOURspZhN8X5p7qAMvGI4xHPeQCdHzGv\r\nnRh4AMu2u5/tNX/RVm/GWDE=\r\n=/PvK\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Baruch Ben-David","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
