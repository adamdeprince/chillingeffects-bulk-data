It is a well known documented fact that mice and\n \nrats do not co-habitat. We have cleaners who work extremely hard at\nkeeping  \nall rooms cleaned. We also have a contract with a  well known\nlinen/laundry  \ncompany, and spend many thousands of pounds a year, we can provide\ninvoices  \nif required. We have 4 communal showers and 14 en-suites, so the statement\n \nregarding showers is incorrect. With regard to the locks not working it\nmay  \nbe the case that the customer could not work the lock properly although we\n \nexplain how to work them when the customers arrive we have an extensive  \nmaintenance regime and all locks work properly. As to the comment\nregarding  \nthe area I can only say that I have worked in the area for 23 years and  \nhave never felt threatened in any way. We have staff on site 24hrs a day  \n\nand CCTV cameras on site also.\nI respectfully request that this inaccurate and malicious review be\nremoved.\nYours sincerely\nPaul Fosh","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=amhurst+hotel&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=amhurst+hotel&cid=0,0,9907850864956456786&ei=pdfRT8WCGs64hAe1ndnrAw&oi=local_result&ved=0CDoQ_BIwAA"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
