You may also be using the term \"newshole\" as well.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that \"Newshole\" has been our registered trademark with the United States Patent Office since 1999 and unofficially in use by us for years before that registration. So it has been obviously in use by us for quite a number of years before your action.\r\n\r\nSome preliminary evidence of this would have been seen when you had applied for your domain registration, as we already had .com and .net domains.  A further check would have noted our registered trademark.\r\n\r\nConsequently, please cease the use of the term \"newshole\" immediately as it is unauthorized by us and is a clear violation of our trademark.\r\n\r\n[private] President\r\nMulti-Strategy Publishers, Inc.\r\nBox 23, Grand Central P.O.\r\nNew York, NY 10163\r\n[private]\r\n\r\n------\r\nWe repeat:  Cease the use of the term \"newshole\" immediately.
