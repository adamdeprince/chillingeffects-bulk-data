The Woody-Cart is a push-powered ride-on vehicle for children up to four years old. The basic idea behind the Woody-Cart was to build a high class, timeless designer piece that is liked by children and parents alike. The stunning push-powered has been engineered in the basis of photographs and vintage paintings of the mahogany wood boat classics of the \u201850s. The Woody-Cart is made in the style of classic wooden motor boats such as those of Riva, Chris Craft or Boesch.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://carbuildingz.blogspot.com/2011/04/woody-cart-kids-vehicle-draws.html"},{"url":"http://carsbitblogsport.blogspot.com/2011/04/woody-cart-kids-vehicle-draws.html"},{"url":"http://livingproper.com/2011/04/woody-cart-kids%E2%80%99-vehicle-draws-inspiration-from-mahogany-wooden-boats/"},{"url":"http://recingcarspotblogs.blogspot.com/2011/04/woody-cart-kids-vehicle-draws.html"},{"url":"http://topgearnew.blogspot.com/2011/04/woody-cart-kids-vehicle-draws.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.bornrich.com/entry/woody-cart-kids-vehicle-draws-inspiration-from-mahogany-wooden-boats/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
