The IFPI is\r\na trade association whose member companies are some 1,450 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member\r\ncompanies in matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings,\r\nincluding enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the\r\nInternet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting infringing files on its\r\nnetwork (see above-referenced directory).  These files contain sound\r\nrecordings by the artists known as Audioslave, The Killers and The Eagles.\r\nThese sound recordings are owned by some of our member companies and have\r\nnot been authorized for this kind of use.  We have a good faith belief\r\nthat the above-described activity is not authorized by the copyright\r\nowner, its agent, or the law.  We assert that the information in this\r\nnotification is accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing files\r\nfrom your system or that you disable access to the infringing files.  In\r\naddition, please inform the site operator of the illegality of his or her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice. In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, if you\r\nignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be liable for any\r\nresulting infringement. This letter does not constitute a waiver of any\r\nright to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such unauthorized\r\nactivities, and such rights as well as claims for other relief are\r\nexpressly retained.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me at IFPI Secretariat, 54 Regent Street, London W1B 5RE,\r\nUnited Kingdom or email Notices@ifpi.org, to discuss this notice.  We\r\nawait your response.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Paul Mitchell\r\n\r\nInternet Anti-Piracy Administrator\r\nIFPI Secretariat\r\n54 Regent Street\r\n\r\nLondon W1B 5RE\r\n\r\nUnited Kingdom\r\n\r\nTel: +44 (0)20 7878 7915\r\n\r\nFax: +44 (0)20 7878 6832\r\n\r\nE-mail: Notices@ifpi.org\r\nWebsite:  <http://www.ifpi.org/> www.ifpi.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCC5qBvK/XpJs6oyURArENAJ4pbsVMSYzPP1ovXc24CLuS1CcCqgCdEuvQ\r\n4LuqJnEeqYXF2iYXl9SBBnQ=\r\n=qkZz\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-02-10T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-10T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"IFPI","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
