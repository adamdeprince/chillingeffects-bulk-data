This illegal use of\r\nmy artworks, Blossoming Joy and Urban Feathers, at \r\nhttp://www.pyzam.com/backgrounds/code/678, and \r\nhttp://www.pyzam.com/backgrounds/code/692 is originally from my website\r\ncalled DragonWinter at www.dragonwinter.deviantart.com. This is original\r\ncontent and I am the artist and copyright holder. Use of copyright\r\nprotected material without permission is illegal under copyright laws. \r\n\r\nUnder the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, I am informing you that the\r\noriginal internet posting of my artworks can be found at \r\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46255325 and \r\nhttp://www.deviantart.com/deviation/46029172/. Both the original date of\r\nposting and my copyright stamp are on these pages. The first piece is a\r\npurple fractal flower on a black background. The original has my\r\nwatermarks on it; those at Pyzam.com that stole this content have\r\nobscured the watermarks by turning the piece upside down and cropping\r\nthem out. The second piece is a bronze/beige/black fractal swirl on a\r\nwhite background. The watermarks on this piece have also been cropped\r\nout. \r\n\r\nI am including with this post the reply I recieved from an owner\r\noperator at Pyzam.com, in which they state that they refuse to remove\r\nthe artwork in question and in which they specifically state that they\r\nuse deviantART.com as a harvesting ground to obtain artwork without\r\nspecific artist permission. I am also including a digital file of my\r\nphysical signature.\r\n\r\nYou may contact me with your reply at:\r\n\r\nNatalie Kelsey\r\nwinterdigitalarts@gmail.com\r\nhttp://dragonwinter.deviantart.com\r\n\r\n97 Canterbury St\r\nBillerica, MA 01821\r\n978-663-9187 \r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials\r\ndescribed above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by my\r\ncopyright and by the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the\r\ninformation in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright\r\nowner of an exclusive right that is infringed. \r\n\r\nYour prompt reply is expected and appreciated.\r\n\r\nNatalie Kelsey\r\n25 February 2007 \r\n\r\n-- \r\nhttp://dragonwinter.deviantart.com/store \r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-02-25T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-25T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"97 Canterbury St","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
