This website is an infringement of copyright law as it wholly reproduces content that is owned by our organisation, NHS Health Scotland (formerly the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS)), and is taken from our website www.hebs.com/readysteadybaby .\r\n\r\nBy visiting our ReadySteadyBaby website, you will see that the site is branded with our corporate logo. This logo links to our corporate website which contains our terms and conditions (http://www.healthscotland.com/terms/index.cfm) that apply to our Health Scotland web services, including readysteadybaby.\r\n\r\nThat 'healthbaby' is a fraudulent site can be demonstrated by visiting the following page on 'healthbaby' http://www.healthbaby.net/moreinfo/obTain.htm. This page contains details on how to obtain a copy of the ReadySteadyBaby book, also published by our organisation and oil which our ReadySteadyBaby website is based. The page contains contact address, telephone and fax details for our organisation, which you can compare with the contact details contained in this letter, although the organisation name has been changed to 'healthbaby'.\r\n\r\nSince receiving my letter the Google Team have advised by email that I write to you again including a full listing of all the pages on the 'healthbaby' website which we believe to be infringing on our copyright. Please find attached a complete list of all pages on the 'healthbaby' website, all of which we believe to infringe on our copyright.\r\n\r\nWe have on previous occasions attempted to contact the 'healthbaby' domain owners to advise them that their reproduction of our content is an infringement of copyright law and to insist they remove our content immediately. We have also pursued legal action through our NHSScotland lawyers, However, we have been unsuccessful in our attempts to have this fraudulent website withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorised by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury consistent with United States Code Title 17, Section 512, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am copyright owner or am authorised to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed,\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\n[private]\r\nConsultant in Public Health Medicine/\r\nDirector of Health Information\r\n\r\nEncls,\r\n\r\nCc:\r\n\r\nEdinburgh office\r\n\t[private], [private], Edinburgh EH1 0 4SG\r\n\tTel: xxxx xxx xxxx Fax: xxxx xxx xxxx\r\n\twww.healthscotland.com\r\n\r\nGlasgow Office [private], [private], Glasgow G3 7LS\r\nhealthyliving\tTel: xxxx xxx xxxx Fax: xxxx xxx xxxx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nListing of all pages on www.healthbaby.net infringing Health Scotland Copyright\r\n\r\nwww.healthhaby.net\r\nPrivacy http://www.healthbaby.net/privacy.htm\r\n\r\nPregnancy http://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/index.htm\r\nHow do you know you are pregnant? http://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/howdoyou.htm\r\nHow long is pregnancy? \r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/howlong.htm\r\nMaking choices \r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/makingchoices.htm\r\nMedical terms \r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/medicalterms.htm\r\nHealthy eating in pregnancy\r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/healthyeating.htm \r\nFoods to avoid \r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/foodstoavoid.htm\r\nPhysical activity and exercise \r\nhttp://www.healthbaby.net/pregnancy/physical.htm\r\nSmoking -
