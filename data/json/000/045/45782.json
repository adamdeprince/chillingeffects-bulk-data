Just in case you haven't noticed, let me tell you a short story about my family: \r\n\r\n My nephew was killed under the pretext that he was a gangster, in fact a hold-up sort of gangster. He was not. Simon was a talented and brilliant young man, just like you but he also worked for the government as an assassin. Some deals went wrong and he was a hunted man. He was killed in cold blood and you all called him a thief. \r\n\r\n I don't know where you live; really don't care but I will find you. And I will make you regret ever putting that post on the web. He was betrayed by Kalenjin colleagues and I will take my revenge. \r\n\r\n Mr. Matheri\r\n        ","date_sent":"2008-01-26T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-01-26T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Alex Matheri","recipient_name":"Kenyan Diaspora Pro-democracy Movement","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
