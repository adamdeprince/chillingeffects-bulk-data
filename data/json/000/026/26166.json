You don\u2019t need to know a  \nstitch of code, and it works just as advertised.\nPagelines is a premium WordPress theme design company. Their offering has  \nbeen just 4 unique themes \u2013 each with a free and a pay version. This pales  \nin comparison to the 20, 40 or 100 themes that some designers offer for the  \nWordPress platform.\"\n\n\"To be honest, as a user of pagelines premium wordpress themes, when I  \ninstalled the theme at the first time I was overwhelmed. I had never seen  \nso many options in a theme before. You can literally change everything \u2013  \nand true to their promise \u2013 without needing to know any code.\"\n\n\"Right away, I started changing the location of the navigation bar,  \nreformatting the footers and sidebars and adjusting from fixed width to  \nfull width and back again. I was looking for glitches, for errors and  \nproblems. But there wasn\u2019t any. It easily adjusted and updated virtually  \ninstantly. There were no long wait times. \"","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://pagelinescouponcodes.blogspot.com/2012/04/pagelines-coupon-pagelines-discount.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
