I am the author of most of the material at \r\nhttp://explorers.whyte.com/100books/nwgbooks.htm, \"The 100 Greatest Books in History\". While the actual list of book titles was compiled (as I state) by the Norwegian Book Clubs, all the rest of the commentary on the page is written by me and is therefore my copyright. \r\n\r\n2. This entire page has been copied, including all my formatting and links apart from font face, to \r\nhttp://greatest-books.blogspot.com/2006/08/100-greatest-books-in-history.html without my permission. You will see that I have posted a comment to the blog requesting the removal of the material; however it is still there. \r\n\r\n3. I can be contacted by post at \r\nNicholas Whyte, \r\nFrancis Crabbestraat 15a, \r\nBelgium \r\nor by email at nicholas.whyte@gmail.com \r\n\r\n4.
