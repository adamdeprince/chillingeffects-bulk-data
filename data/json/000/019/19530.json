Web design is a rendition of what a web site will look like and what it will do. Web design is the starting point where we gather the information to sketch your site's look, feel, and functionality. Do you want shopping carts? A photo gallery? Do you need online forms? What colors do you envision? Think of web design as the blueprint an architect would use to build a brick-and-mortar site.\r\n\r\nWeb development is what it takes to build your site. It's the steps that must be taken to make your presence a reality. It might help to imagine a construction worker laying brick after brick. All web sites have a design and a development phase. From making your color choice appear online to including shopping carts, photo galleries, and forms, these aspects require coding and programming.\r\n\r\nWeb Design + Web Development = Web Site\"\r\n\r\nI did send screenshots and an email to the owner of the site and have heard nothing back from them and the content still remains.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.nokshihost.com/development.php"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.marydesigns.com/website-development.htm"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
