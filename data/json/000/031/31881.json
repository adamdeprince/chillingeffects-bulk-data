We have made several attempts to contact you to resolve\r\nthis issue and they have all gone unanswered. This is our final request\r\nasking you as the ISP to take action against these websites who continue to\r\nuse Yamaha trademarked logos and copyrighted images, by shutting down there\r\nwebsites or by asking your clients to remove all Yamaha logos and\r\ncopyrighted images and text from their entire website. In the DMCA act you\r\nare currently protected against any legal action that maybe taken against\r\nyou, the ISP, if you comply, but a failure to comply would release you from\r\nthis protection and any legal action taken against your client will be also\r\ntaken against you as the ISP for allowing the non-authorized use of these\r\ntrademarked logos and copyrighted images and text. Please send me a response\r\nby COB or I will assume you are not in compliance and will make our client\r\naware of your decision.
