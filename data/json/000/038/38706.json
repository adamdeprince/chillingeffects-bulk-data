The IFPI is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies are some 1,450 major and\r\nindependent record companies in the US and internationally who create,\r\nmanufacture and distribute sound recordings. Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the IFPI is authorized to act on behalf of its member companies\r\nin matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, including\r\nenforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that your service is hosting the above infringing files on\r\nits network.  These files contain sound recordings by the artist known as\r\nBen Folds.  These sound recordings are owned by one of our member companies\r\nand have not been authorized for this kind of use.  We have a good faith\r\nbelief that the above-described activity is not authorized by the copyright\r\nowner, its agent, or the law.  We assert that the information in this\r\nnotification is accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this unauthorized\r\nactivity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the infringing files\r\nfrom your system or that you disable access to the infringing files.  In\r\naddition, please inform the site operator of the illegality of his or her\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that this\r\nsite operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring on your\r\nservice.
