You are of course welcome to your opinions regarding what you perceive as \r\nmy priorities, despite the fact that they are incorrect. Your perception of my interest in money is \r\nalso incorrect, but please do feel free to hold to your opinion. You should be aware that I did not \r\ntake your comments lightly, and spent some considerable time talking to my guides in Moshi, passing \r\non your words verbatim and listening to their responses. That is a part of my job.\r\n\r\nI would ask that you remove my company name from your mass email on your website. What you say \r\nverbally is entirely at your discretion of course but what you have written constitutes libel, \r\nespecially when you directly comment that I 'accused' you of bringing situations upon yourself. I \r\nsimply related to you the response of my guides, whom I trust implicitly after a very long time \r\nworking with them. \r\n\r\nYour response to this would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n[Sender]","date_sent":"2004-11-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-11-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":"none","principal_name":null,"recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
