We believe that the Internet access of the user engaging in this infringement is provided by Cox Communications or a downstream service provider who purchases this connectivity from Cox Communications.  \r\n\r\nThis unauthorized copying and distribution constitutes copyright infringement under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act .  Depending upon the type of service Cox Communications is providing to this IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does not expeditiously remove or disable access to the motion picture(s) listed below, or if it fails to implement a policy that provides for termination of subscribers who are repeat infringers (see, 17 U.S.C. ?512).\r\n\r\nDespite the above, Universal believes that the entire Internet community benefits when these matters are resolved cooperatively. We urge you to take immediate action to stop this infringing activity and inform us of the results of your actions. We appreciate your efforts toward this common goal.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has a good faith belief that use of the motion pictures in the manner described herein is not authorized by Universal, its agent or the law.
