As near as we can tell, over thirty of\r\nour revenue-producing pages have been redirected to this pirated website,\r\nand we are quite distressed. \r\n \r\nOur website, the original one is here http://www.meowhoo.com\r\n<http://www.meowhoo.com/>   \r\n \r\nYou will see our names in the about section of the website here:\r\nhttp://www.meowhoo.com/about/index.html\r\nand you can see us here  http://www.meowhoo.com/about/index.html#team.\r\n \r\nThe other website;the fake, the charlatan the crook is here:\r\nhttp://www.meowhoocat.hst0.com/\r\n \r\nIf you look through the duplicate site, you will see several things that\r\nmight make your alarm bells go off. \r\n \r\n*        First the website information is old, ours is current, still adding\r\nlisters daily. \r\n \r\n*        The photo contest features an old one, run last year. \r\n\r\n*        The games do not work. \r\n\r\n*        Most of the interior pages, except for those 30 some pages of ads\r\nrevert right back to us. \r\n \r\nSo I guess this is a half-assed crook. I am sorry, but I am furious here\r\nthat this could have happened. We estimate this crook has cost us quite a\r\nloss in revenue so far.\r\n \r\nMy partner in this venture lives in Israel. So you can get in touch with me\r\neasier-\r\n \r\nMary Anne Miller\r\n28510 Santiam Highway\r\nSweet Home  OR  97386\r\n541-367-4927           (anytime)\r\n \r\nPlease we implore you to take this fake website off the Internet! \r\n \r\nWe have already contacted a lawyer on this.  \r\n \r\nI am also sending as per your instructions on your website \r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/ a copy of this letter in hard copy-\r\ncertified mail express delivery.\r\n \r\nI have the following information about the cyber thief that our tech team\r\nwas able to come up with\r\n \r\nAlexey Mints (HST0-COM-DOM)\r\n840 8th Ave\r\nNew York, New York 10018\r\nUS\r\n+380.629343549\r\nakunamatata@mariupol.net\r\n\r\nDomain Name: HST0.COM\r\n\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\nAlexey Mints akunamatata@mariupol.net\r\n840 8th Ave\r\nNew York, New York 10018\r\nUS\r\n+380.629343549\r\n \r\n \r\nAlexey A. Mints (Saint Petersburg State University) [minz@decosp.spb.ru]\r\n \r\nI hope that this information is sufficient for you to act promptly and\r\nremove this person off the web!
