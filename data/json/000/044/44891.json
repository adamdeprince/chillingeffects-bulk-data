This is clearly a case of mistaken identity and I don't understand how I can be accused of downloading/uploading/sharing files when I didn't even have the software necessary\r\n\r\nSecondly, this subpoena was served in Philadelphia and since I am no longer a resident nor do I work in that city/state, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania does not have jurisdiction over this case.","date_sent":"2007-11-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-11-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Conrad, O'Brien, Gellman & Rohn, P.C.","principal_name":"University of Pennsylania on behalf of SONG BMG","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
