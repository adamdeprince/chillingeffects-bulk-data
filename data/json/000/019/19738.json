They use the exact same posting each  \n\ntime to try and discredit Eduardo the project manager but not My company  \n\nLevel One Maintenance Ltd.\nThis is malicious and is now approaching harassment toward my employe Mr. \n\nSilva and my company Level One Maintenance Ltd.\nTheir entire statement is false and libelous at best and short of  \nharassment.\nI would hope that Google would force this person to either identify  \nthemselves so we can prove as a company that we have never worked for them\n \nand thus opening the door for us to eventually file suit for libel against\n \nthis person.  If it were indeed a client I would respond to this  \ncomplaint.  However, we are 100% certain who this person is and Yelp felt \n\ntheir false comments warranted removal because this person refuses to  \nidentify themselves.  I have personally talked to each and every client at\n \nthe end of each project and not once did anyone ever complain about my  \nproject manager so I therefore feel I have a need to defend my company  \nabout these frivolous claims","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"https://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=level+one+vancouver&fb=1&gl=ca&hq=level+one&hnear=0x548673f143a94fb3:0xbb9196ea9b81f38b,Vancouver,+BC&cid=0,0,12229218344120174992&ei=nAkXUO3OEcq2rQHGjIH4Ag&sqi=2&ved=0CJUBEPwSMAA"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
