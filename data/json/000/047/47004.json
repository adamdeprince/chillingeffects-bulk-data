{"dmca":{"id":47004,"type":"Dmca","title":"Slandering Billbell?","body":"This is the user formally known as \"billbell48.\"\r\n \r\nI am requesting that you remove my name and any personal negative references off of your forum post immediately. The fact that you questioned my knowledge of a veto is, in my opinion, negative and may call into question my competence. Consider this a cease and desist letter.\r\n \r\nIf this is not done, I will consider this slander and take appropriate legal action, and all further contact will be made through my attorney.\r\n \r\nThank you for your cooperation.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nWilliam Bell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLink in question is unobtainable. I was banned from the website, and cannot access the defamation. I do have a hard copy of the page in question, however.
