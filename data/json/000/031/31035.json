Scripps Company is the parent company of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado.  In that capacity, it has come to my attention that a web site created by you to display a video game about the Columbine High School massacre has been brought to my attention.\r\n\r\nBased upon my review of the web site www.columbinegame.com, it is clear that you are using several Pulitzer Prize winning photographs taken by photographers employed by The Rocky Mountain News at the time of the shootings.  Please be advised that those photographs are the copyrighted property of The Rocky Mountain News.  \r\n\r\nThere is no record of you requesting or receiving permission to use any photographs from the Rocky Mountain News on your web site or in the video game.  Therefore, I request that you immediately cease and desist from using any photographs taken by, originally published by or owned by The Rocky Mountain News.  Any failure to abide by this request could result in litigation, which would include a request for an injunction. \r\n\r\nThank you for your anticipated cooperation in this regard.  Nothing contained in this letter constitutes an express or implied waiver of any rights, remedies, or defenses of The E.W. Scripps Company or The Rocky Mountain News.  \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID M. GILES\r\nAssociate General Counsel\r\nThe E. W.
