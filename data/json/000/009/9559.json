{"dmca":{"id":9559,"type":"Dmca","title":"ADULT CALLBACK - GENERAL FEEDBACK","body":"Dear Sir or Madam\r\n\r\nI'm not a solicitor, but enquiring about the legality of a particular website. www.angelsphonesex.com advertises phone sex between two adults, which is legal I'm assuming in most countries. However, in a particular conversation with one lady (I called them), she started talking about underage sex. Also, beastailaity was mentioned. \r\n\r\nEven though this wasn't 'seen' or acted out in real, as its just fantasy, is this a breach in the law? Although I'm in England, I assumed that the law will be virtually the same as the USA.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure who to contact regarding this, as Google only linked me to your site, and not a UK type.\r\n\r\nAs I've used this service, i've removed my name and address, in case they happen to see this letter, but included my email address, which I would be very grateful in seeing a reply.\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-12-26T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-12-26T05:00:00Z","topics":["Uncategorized","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"www.angelsphonesex.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
