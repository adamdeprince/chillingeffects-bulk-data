The owners of the bbfine.com domain name host their\r\nweb site at theplanet.com   \r\n \r\nBbfine.com is a complete duplicate of the myfreshbaby.com web site.  They\r\nhave altered our company logo (to remove our name) and changed all the\r\nreferences of Fresh Baby to Bbfine.  However, they have NOT changed the\r\npersonnel names, phone numbers or addresses.  In addition, the links to our\r\nnewsletter service and our online store are intact.  I am concerned that\r\nthis company (domain) may be stealing credit card information or email\r\naddresses from my customers. Our newsletter is published monthly and\r\narchived on our Web site . Based on the content on Bbfine.com, it looks like\r\nthe site was copied over sometime in AUG/SEP 2004  (\r\n<http://www.bbfine.com/healthy_eating/archive.cfm>\r\nhttp://www.bbfine.com/healthy_eating/archive.cfm)\r\n \r\nWe have never given bbfine.com permission to use or copy any of the material\r\non  <http://www.myfreshbaby.com> www.myfreshbaby.com.  To our knowledge, no\r\none from bbfine.com has ever contacted anyone at Fresh Baby. I would like to\r\nrequest that you shut this site down immediately because of theft of copy\r\nwritten content (the content on our site clearly states copy write 2002 and\r\nbbfine.com states 2004).  \r\n \r\nI am an the CEO and owner of Fresh Baby,  The information provided in this\r\ne-mail is accurate and truthful. I am authorized to act on behalf of the\r\ncomplaining party, Fresh Baby. I appreciate your prompt attention to this\r\nmatter. Please provide me with a status and contact information.\r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nCheryl Tallman \r\n(signature attached) and full contact information below\r\n\r\nCheryl Tallman\r\nFresh Baby\r\n616 Petoskey Street\r\nSuite 202\r\nPetoskey, MI 49770\r\nP:(231) 348-2706\r\nF:(231) 348-5374\r\nE:cheryl.tallman@freshbaby.com\r\nW:http://www.freshbaby.com <http://www.freshbaby.com/> \r\n\r\nSign up for Fresh Ideas and get great tips on healthy eating for your\r\nfamily.  http://www.myfreshbaby.com/healthy_eating/archive.cfm\r\n\r\n ","date_sent":"2003-08-20T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-08-20T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
