{"dmca":{"id":22566,"type":"Dmca","title":"Trademark Infringement - Oolong Tea","body":"We represent Okuma Nutritionals, LLC (\"Okuma\") owner and operator of the www.wulongforlife.com website and owner of the trademark WU-LONG. It has recently come to our attention that through its website, www.tealaden.com (the \"Site\"), Tea Laden, Inc. is infringing upon Okuma's trademark rights by using the mark WU-LONG  to refer to generic oolong tea which it offers for on-line sale.\r\n\r\nThis conduct violates Section 43(a)(1)(A) and 43(a)(1)(B) of the Lanham Act and analogous state statutory and common law. Okuma is the creator of the WU-LONG mark. Okuma has used the mark continuously in commerce in connection with its oolong tea product and has made substantial economic investments in the marketing and promotion of the mark. Tea Laden's use of the term WU-LONG as a synonym for generic oolong tea in connection with its oolong tea sales is likely to cause confusion among consumers and constitutes an unfair trade practice, and thus is in contravention of basic principles of trademark and unfair competition law.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask that Tea Laden immediately cease and desist from using the term WE-LONG to market its oolong tea. In order that both Okuma and Tea Laden can avoid the expenses of litigation, we ask that you comply with the foregoing demands not later than June 4, 2007.\r\n\r\nWe thank you for your cooperation in the matter.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\n[private]","date_sent":"2007-05-24T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-05-24T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Okuma Nutritionals, LLC","recipient_name":"Tea Laden","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
