{"dmca":{"id":14446,"type":"Dmca","title":"Lacetoleather complains of blogged copies","body":"Dear Sirs: \r\n\r\nThe blogger at thenaturalcure.blogspot.com has copied most of their content from my website word for word - 70 (seventy) pages worth. This blogger began in 2006. My web pages are listed on web.archive.org back to April, 2000, and are registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. \"Chrit\" did not ask my permission and does not give me credit on the blog. I can't write Chrit and complain or demand that my content be taken down because there is no email address listed. (There is no excuse for you to not have a way for your bloggers to be contacted; if Craig's List can manage anonymous communications, you certainly can.) Since this matter must now be dealt with through you, I demand that all of this content be removed, and I want this blogger shut down and banned from starting a new blog. If my content is not removed, I demand the name, address, phone, and email address for Chrit so I can deal with this in court.\r\n\r\nThe thefts listed on the following pages contain the url from thenaturalcure.blogspot, date, title, post author, post time, and the url from Iacetoleather.com containing the copyrighted text. The listings are separated by url and date. \r\n\r\nUnless otherwise noted, the information stolen from my web pages was copied word for word, with the exception of the addition, change or removal of an affiliate text link (e.g., a brand of shampoo was no longer available). \r\n\r\nAll of the web pages of mine that were copied can also be found indexed on Safe Natural Cures, part 1 - http://www.lacetoleather.com/safnatcur.html; Safe Natural Cures, part 2 - http://www.lacetoleather.com/safenaturalcures.html; Safe Natural Cures, part 3 - http://www.lacetoleather.com/safenaturalcures2.html; and Lace to Leather Site Map - http://www.lacetoleather.com/sitemap.html.
