PBC is the owner of the world famous PEBBLE BEACH RESORTS and PEBBLE BEACH GOLF LINKS.  We are vigilant in protecting our trademark rights because of their importance and value to PBC and to the companies to which we license our Marks.\r\n\r\nIt has come to our attention that IFSOMUX.ORG is using our trademark, PEBBLE BEACH to describe the fictional town in an on-line video game.  Because your use depicting PEBBLE BEACH creates confusion in the marketplace as to whether PBC endorses, sponsers or is affiliated with your company, we ask that you immediately cease and desist from any further advertising and use that falsely suggests that your company is in any way endorsed, sponsered, authorized or licensed by, or affiliated with, PBC.\r\n\r\nPlease indicate your agreement to the foregoing terms within 10 business days of receipt, by signing this letter below and returning it to me.\r\n\r\nIf there are questions or you would like clarification regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to call me.  I may be reached at (831) 625-8480.\r\n\r\nThank you for respecting the proprietary rights of PBC.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\nPEBBLE BEACH COMPANY\r\n\r\n(Private), Legal Analyst","date_sent":"2001-06-03T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2001-06-03T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Pebble Beach Company","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
