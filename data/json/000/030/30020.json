Due to the fact that this is\r\nnot a local issue, there is nothing I can do at this point with my local\r\nlaw enforcement.  However, having my copyrighted material removed from\r\nthe site will go a long way in helping me stop this harassment and the\r\nabuse of this person.\r\n\r\nSince I am a writer and my name is out there so is my reputation.  I\r\nfeel that what is going on here is a threat to my name as well.  I have\r\nworked hard for what I do have and am asking you if this person has the\r\nright to be allowed to work to destroy what I have done?  At this point\r\nyou are the only one who can remove my work from this site.  The owner\r\nof the site has not responded or done anything to remove my work.\r\n\r\nCrystal Miller\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: abuseadm@theplanet.com [mailto:abuseadm@theplanet.com] On Behalf\r\nOf Policy Enforcement\r\nSent: Tuesday, June 06, 2006 4:52 AM\r\nTo: Crystal\r\nSubject: Re: [ABUSE] Abuse!
