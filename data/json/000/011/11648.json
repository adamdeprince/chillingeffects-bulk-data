These rights are as follows:\r\n(1) the right of reproduction (i.e., copying),\r\n(2) the right to create derivative works,\r\n(3) the right to distribution,\r\n(4) the right to performance,\r\n(5) the right to display, and\r\n(6) the digital transmission performance right.\r\n\r\n The law of copyright protects the first two rights in both private and public contexts. An author can only restrict the last four rights in the public sphere. Claims of infringement must show that the defendant exercised one of the rights. \r\n\r\n Please give (my name) of (company) credit.\r\n\r\n Thank you,\r\n\r\n_________________________\r\n\r\nIs this an appropriate letter for me to send to a competitor using my work to attract business?\r\nDo I first need to copyright my work?\r\nHe is in the lighting rental business and so am I.\r\nI do not represent the band, but I set-up the set and the lighting pictured on his web site.
