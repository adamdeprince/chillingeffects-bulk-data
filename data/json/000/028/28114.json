We believe that the\r\nInternet access of the user engaging in this infringement is provided by\r\nTheplanet.Com Internet Services or a downstream service provider who\r\npurchases this connectivity from Theplanet.Com Internet Services.  \r\n\r\nThis unauthorized copying and distribution constitutes copyright\r\ninfringement under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act .  Depending\r\nupon the type of service Theplanet.Com Internet Services is providing to\r\nthis IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does\r\nnot expeditiously remove or disable access to the (property)(s) listed\r\nbelow, or if it fails to implement a policy that provides for\r\ntermination of subscribers who are repeat infringers (see, 17 U.S.C.\r\n512).\r\n\r\nDespite the above, MGM believes that the entire Internet community\r\nbenefits when these matters are resolved cooperatively. We urge you to\r\ntake immediate action to stop this infringing activity and inform us of\r\nthe results of your actions. We appreciate your efforts toward this\r\ncommon goal.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has a good faith belief that use of the (property)(s) in\r\nthe manner described herein is not authorized by MGM, its agent or the\r\nlaw.  The information contained in this notification is accurate.  Under\r\npenalty of perjury, the undersigned is authorized to act on behalf of\r\nMGM with respect to this matter.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised that this letter is not and is not intended to be a\r\ncomplete statement of the facts or law as they may pertain to this\r\nmatter or of MGM's positions, rights or remedies, legal or equitable,\r\nall of which are specifically reserved.  \r\n\r\nPlease direct all correspondence to:\r\nhttp://webreply.baytsp.com/webreply/webreply.jsp?customerid=214&commhash\r\n=2db5c8f4dbbb70920df7d6f8e9a0db68\r\n\r\nPlease direct any further questions or comments to:\r\nmailto:mgm2@copyright-compliance.com?subject=RE%3A%20DMCA%20Notice%20Una\r\nuthorized%20Use%20of%20Metro%20Goldwyn%20Mayer%20Property%20%20Notice%20\r\nID%3A%20214%2D94662\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nCompliance Team\r\nCompliance Manager\r\nBayTSP, Inc.\r\nPO Box 1314\r\nLos Gatos, CA 95031\r\n\r\nv: 408-341-2300\r\nf:  408-341-2399\r\n\r\n*pgp public key is available on the key server at\r\nldap://keyserver.pgp.com\r\nNote:  The information transmitted in this Notice is intended only for\r\nthe person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain\r\nconfidential and/or privileged material.
