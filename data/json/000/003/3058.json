Our publishing company owns the copyright for several\ncomic-book companies, including Marvel Comics, Star Wars Comics, The\nWalking Dead, and Hellboy, among others. We've been struggling with\nillegal digital copies of the comic books we publish in Argentina (and\nother Latin American countries).\nSome groups started scanning original comics in English and translated\nthem to Spanish. After that, they share them so people from all around the\n\nworld can download them for free. In some cases, they've scanned our own\ntranslated comics and shared them. These activities have had a very\nnegative impact in our business, so we can't keep making a blind eye at\nthem.\n\nOne of these groups is called ComicCoon BlogSpot  \n(http://http://comicoon.blogspot.com.ar) and is\nusing your hosting to distribute this unauthorized material.
