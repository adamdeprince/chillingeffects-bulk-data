Upon browsing a web site\r\nthat is hosted in your data center (neonewsinc.com) I found that they had\r\nstolen content from me.\r\n\r\nTheir page:\r\nhttp://www.neonewsinc.com/avatarhelp.php\r\n\r\nOur page:\r\nhttp://avatars.neonewsnow.com\r\n\r\nThe only difference is that ours is divided up into pages, and theirs is on\r\none page, but if you looked around everything else is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nI saw in the name server listing they were hosted by NextDesigns.net, but\r\ntheir name server information was under a Whois Protect service, so I used\r\nNeoTrace and did an IP Trace and found out they were hosted at The Planet.\r\n\r\nI am an administrator with a company that has thirteen servers at The\r\nPlanet, and this will represent how you typically act in situations like\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nAs for my web site, it has close to 4,000 members, and gets 5,000 unique\r\nhits per day, as for theirs, it has under 200 members, and gets only a\r\nhundred or two hundred unique hits per day.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDouglas Hanna\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/aup/\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCrhMBvK/XpJs6oyURAhflAJsGK/iKWAINHQbDhwz5Wba/0DYu0QCeOGnb\r\nTaGCZX3ix3EtVGcxr7mtvKc=\r\n=3m7B\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2005-06-13T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-13T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"NeoNewsNow.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
