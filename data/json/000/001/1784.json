{"dmca":{"id":1784,"type":"Dmca","title":"Subpoena Report","body":"ISP : Camcast Cable Communications, Inc.\r\n\r\nSituation:\r\nThree(3) people live together in one house as a roommate. We have three computers with three IP addresses. I am the one who pays the bills. So, all three IPs are under my name because additional IP cost only $5 per IP. One of my roommates has IP address that subpoena caught in her computer. However, all IP address is under my name with Camcast Cable. They sent my identity to RIAA. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat should I do? Do I have liability for my roommate's IP because I am the one who pays bills? Isn't there any way I have to prepare now? Screen name in subpoena showing her name would help me to prove that I am not the one? Thank you.\r\n\r\n  ","date_sent":"2003-07-09T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2003-07-09T04:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp LLP","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
