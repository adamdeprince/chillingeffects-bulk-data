I have mentioned about the most popular shares which are as follows:-\r\n\r\nEquity shares: These shares are also known as ordinary shares. They are the shares which do not enjoy any preference regarding payment of dividend and repayment of capital. They are given dividend at a fluctuating rate. The dividend on equity shares depends on the profits made by a company. Higher the profits, higher will be the dividend, where as lower the profits, lower will be the dividend.\r\n\r\nPreference shares: These shares are those shares which are given preference as regards to payment of dividend and repayment of capital. They do not enjoy normal voting rights. Preference shareholders have some preference over the equity shareholders, as in the case of winding up of the company, they are paid their capital first. They can vote only on the matters affecting their own interest. These shares are best suited to investors who want to have security of fixed rate of dividend and refund of capital in case of winding up of the company.\r\n\r\nDeferred shares: These shares are those shares which are held by the founders or pioneer or beginners of the company. They are also called as Founder shares or Management shares. In deferred shares, the right to share profits of the company is deferred, i.e. postponed till all the other shareholders receive their normal dividends. Being the last claimants of the profits.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.oppapers.com/essays/Stocks/705684"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/109152-Types-Shares.aspx"}]},{"description":"The article at the infringing location is a word by word copy of our original article.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of shares.
