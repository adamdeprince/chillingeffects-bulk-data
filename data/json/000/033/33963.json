I am reporting copyright violation from a site\r\nthat is registered to you: icecaves.net.  The webmaster of this site has\r\nacquired a script that I wrote by viewing the page source of another\r\nsite that I allowed to use the script.  I wrote the script over a year\r\nago for an old website of mine called Neopian Frenzy.  Due to medical\r\nproblems, I discontinued NF, but continued to allow Sissy of nhfa.net to\r\nuse it. She has credited me appropriately as I wrote it and she does not\r\nallow people to use that unless they contact me first.\r\nhttp://nhfa.net/?page=petcolors  That is the page that Sissy has posted\r\nthe script. She does not know how to update the script, so it is very\r\nout-dated. If you notice in the source code to her page and the source\r\ncode to icecaves.net the form names are identical. The only difference\r\nis that Sissy has the js directly on the page (which is also how I used\r\nto do it) while icecaves.net links to a separate .js file for the actual\r\nscr!\r\n ipt code. Either way, it is no coincidence that the script was stolen\r\nfrom Sissy, when I just recently created another website intending to\r\nonce again use the script that I wrote and icecaves.net was only created\r\nin April of this year. They have also added the copyright information\r\nthat everything not copyright by Neopets, Inc. is copyright icecaves.net\r\nwhich is of course meaning that they are claiming to have written that\r\nparticular script themselves.  My new site, Easy-Peasey also has my\r\nscript on it. As I just created this new site, it is rather new, but I\r\nupdated the script as it was in dire need. Here's the link to my page:\r\nhttp://easy-peasy.awardspace.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&\r\nid=16&Itemid=27  I want the situation to be rectified. icecaves.net does\r\nNOT have permission to use my script and certainly has no right to lay\r\nclaim to it themselves.  Please correct this as soon as possible, as I\r\nwrote to the webmaster of icecaves.net and gave them 3 days to r!\r\n emove the script. They have neither removed the script, nor bothered t\r\no contact me back. If you need more information, I will do my best to\r\nprovide it to you.  I expect to hear back from you soon. \r\n \r\nCourtesies,\r\nLindsey A.
