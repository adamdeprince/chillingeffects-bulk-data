While no judicial\r\ndetermination of infringement has been made, we have a good faith belief\r\nthat this activity violates copyright laws and probably your terms of\r\nservice as well.  In contacting you in this manner, we seek your prompt\r\nassistance in having the content removed or activity discontinued.\r\nVoluntary, appropriate action can both render legal measures unnecessary and\r\nserve a positive educational purpose.\r\n\r\nAuction Details:\r\nhttp://www.atoncer.com/cgi-bin/auction/view?cmd=view&listingID=981614\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\nSeller ID: Tx_sales\r\nItem# 981614\r\n\r\nBased upon BSA's representation of the copyright owners in anti-piracy\r\nmatters, we have a good faith belief that none of the materials or\r\nactivities listed above have been authorized by the rightholders, their\r\nagents, or the law.  BSA represents that the information in this\r\nnotification is accurate and states, under penalty of perjury, that it is\r\nauthorized to act in this matter on behalf of the copyright owners listed\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nMaking copyrighted software available for unathorized sale online is highly\r\ndamaging to copyright holders and wastes your network resources.\r\nFurthermore, such unauthorized acitivity exposes the offender and related\r\nthird parties to potential legal liability.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your cooperation in protecting legitimate interests and making\r\nthe Internet a safe and legal environment.  Please advise us regarding what\r\nactions you take.\r\n\r\nPlease include the following CaseID in any response you send: Case ID\r\n135726039\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Wolfe\r\nDirector of Internet Enforcement\r\nBusiness Software Alliance\r\nhttp://www.bsa.org\r\nE-mail: copyright@bsa.org\r\n","date_sent":"2006-03-14T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-03-14T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"BSA (Business Software Alliance)","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
