PCI device list","body":"Dear [Private]:\r\n\r\nWe are writing on behalf of our client, PCI-SIG, Inc., an Oregon nonprofit corporation (\"PCI-SIG\"). PCI-SIG is the industry organization that owns and manages PCI specifications as open industry standards. The organization defines and implements new industry standard I/O (Input/Output) specifications as the industry's local I/O needs evolve. PCI-SIG was formed in 1992. Currently, more than 800 industry-leading companies are active PCI-SIG members.\r\n\r\nPCI-SIG owns the exclusive rights to use the \"PCI' family of marks in connection with providing consumer product information regarding product capability and compatibility, including the mark and logo \"PCI\" bearing U.S. Trademark Registration Number 2623790. A true and correct copy of the Certificate of Registration for the mark is enclosed. PCI-SIG's trademarks are valid and subsisting.\r\n\r\nIt has recently come to our client's attention that you are using the PCI(R) name and logo on a website maintained by you at http://yourvote.com/pci/. The website purports to provide a database of PCI(R) Vendor numbers and devices. Your use of PCI-SIG's trademarked name and logo on your website is likely to cause consumer confusion in the marketplace as to the sponsorship, affiliation or endorsement of the web site by PCI-SIG. Accordingly, your use of the PCI@ name and logo constitutes trademark infringement and unfair competition under the Federal Trademark (Lanham) Act (15 U.S.C.
