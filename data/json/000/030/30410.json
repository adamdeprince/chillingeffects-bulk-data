The documentation included at the end of this\r\nnotice specifies the location of the infringement.  We believe that the\r\nInternet access of the user engaging in this infringement is provided by\r\nTHEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES or a downstream service provider who\r\npurchases this connectivity from THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES.  \r\n\r\nThis unauthorized copying and distribution constitutes copyright\r\ninfringement under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act.  Depending\r\nupon the type of service THEPLANET.COM INTERNET SERVICES is providing to\r\nthis IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does\r\nnot expeditiously remove or disable access to the property listed below,\r\nor if it fails to implement a policy that provides for termination of\r\nsubscribers who are repeat infringers (see, 17 U.S.C. 512).  \r\n\r\nAlthough various legal and equitable remedies may be available to FOX as\r\na result of such infringement, FOX believes that the entire Internet\r\ncommunity benefits when these matters are resolved cooperatively.  We\r\nurge you to take immediate action to effect removal of the detected\r\ninfringement listed in the attached report, including:\r\n\r\n(1) Notify the account holder of this infringement\r\n(2) Require the account holder remove the infringing material\r\n(3) Disable access to the infringing material\r\n(4) Take appropriate action against the account holder under your Abuse\r\nPolicy/Terms of Service\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your efforts toward this common goal.
