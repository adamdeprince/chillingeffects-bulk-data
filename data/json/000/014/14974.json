I promise\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI live just 30 miles from your ISP/webhost (in San Ramon) and I\r\nwill sue\r\nthem and name you as co-defendant.\r\n\r\nContra Costa Superior Court.\r\n\r\nYou can fly down here for the trial.\r\n\r\nI'm a Taurus, and I will follow thru. I have been considerng\r\ntnis for\r\nyears,and now I >>will<< do it. I see you dumped some of the\r\nstuff on me,\r\nbut I want it all to go.\r\n\r\nCopyright violations on photos, ($50,000 a pop), and libel,\r\nmaybe\r\n$1,000,000 - You seriously affest sales of my\r\n\r\nnew book, and lectures.\r\n\r\nLinda and Jim will join in.  \r\n\r\nAct now, I'll be contacting legal dept of site5.com  Tuesday.\r\nThey already\r\nhave email. I'll also contact their\r\npresident/owner. I will. It will not be worth $9.95 a month web\r\nhost fee to\r\nget sued about you.\r\n\r\n                    100% serious. No playing around.\r\n\r\n                            Jon-Erik Beckjord, MBA (and 1 yr law\r\nstudies UC\r\nBerkeley)\r\n**************************\r\n\r\nI received this message on 29-AUG-06, shortly after which my website account was terminated due to a legal threat my webhost had received from the same person.  I then received another message from the person threatening legal action:\r\n\r\nFrom: eb <rudyrudy3@comcast.net>\r\nTo: ufowatchdog@msn.com\r\nSubject: Goodbye. Do not reappear on net\r\nDate: Mon, 28 Aug 2006 13:53:18\r\n\r\nI will sue you wherever you appear, no matter where.\r\n\r\n                     Beckjord\r\n*****************************\r\n\r\nMy website was down for several days and I was forced to move to a new host, which is costing me more money now.  I was shocked that my entire website could be shut down with one e-mail threat and no actual lawsuit.  Any assistance or advice would be greatly appreciated.  I was sued in 2003 by someone in California claiming that I had libeled them.  They lost the suit after they were hit with a SLAPP.","date_sent":"2006-08-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-08-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":"N/A","principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ufowatchdog.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
