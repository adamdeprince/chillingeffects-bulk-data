I was lucky to cancel my cheque\n \nto them and avoid wasted money for a falsely advertised company. I think  \n\nyou should investigate this further and maybe inform authorities as I\nhave.  \nI wouldn't want any other person to fall victim of this style of fraud.","original_work_urls":[],"problematic_urls":[{"url":"http://www.welcomeloansuk.com"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null,"explanation":null}}
