(RIAA) and its member record companies.  The RIAA is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies create, manufacture and\r\ndistribute approximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound\r\nrecordings sold in the United States.  Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member\r\ncompanies in matters involving the infringement of their sound\r\nrecordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights\r\non the Internet.   \r\n\r\nWe believe your service is hosting the above-referenced files on its\r\nnetwork.  These files offer sound recordings for download by the artist\r\nknown as Gwen Stefani, which have not yet been commercially released.\r\nWe have a good faith belief that the above-described activity is not\r\nauthorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.  We assert\r\nthat the information in this notification is accurate, based upon the\r\ndata available to us.   \r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this\r\nunauthorized activity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the\r\ninfringing files from the system, or that you disable access to the\r\ninfringing files, and that you inform the site operator of the\r\nillegality of his or her conduct. \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that\r\nthis site operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring\r\non your service.  In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright\r\nAct, if you ignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be\r\nliable for any resulting infringement. This letter does not constitute a\r\nwaiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such\r\nunauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims for other\r\nrelief are expressly retained. \r\n\r\nYou may contact me at RIAA, 1330 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 300,\r\nWashington, D.C., 20036, Tel.
