Try These General Tips\r\n\r\n#1 Do NOT take out a wedding loan.\r\nCall me naive, but I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing as a wedding loan till now. Here\u2019s another lovely unsecured personal loan to saddle yourself with. I suppose it\u2019s just another marketing tool for lenders to try to get you to finance yet one more thing in your life. You can of course try to get a secured loan with some asset as collateral but c\u2019mon \u2014 you don\u2019t want to start off your new life on the wrong foot by following these methods.\r\n\r\n#2 Keep an open mind.\r\nDo you really need to keep up with tradition? When planning for my wedding, I seemed to get the impression that traditional etiquette steered away from the \u201ctackiness\u201d of blatant cash exchanges. But tradition often clashes with practicality and when needs arise, it\u2019s time to open one\u2019s mind to resourceful financing tactics. If you can think of weddings as a family affair where everyone can pitch in, all the better. It\u2019s great when one has a rich daddy who can throw a grand wedding for their daughter but more often than not, wedding planning falls on the shoulders of the couple to be married. Be honest, wouldn\u2019t you rather receive something like this or this?\r\n\r\n#3 Do not keep up with the rich Joneses.\r\nWhen you enter the phase where everyone you know is getting married and you are requested to be part of everyone\u2019s bridal party, it\u2019s quite likely you\u2019ll be comparing your own event to everyone else\u2019s. Resist the urge to impress everyone else. I\u2019d say the most memorable or enjoyable weddings I\u2019ve attended haven\u2019t been the most extravagant ones, but rather the most unique or most personal ones, where invited guests already knew each other.\r\n\r\n#4 Don\u2019t ask for a perfect wedding.\r\nRefusing to compromise in pursuit of the \u201cperfect wedding\u201d will cost you a bit. Many event planners who have worked for bridezillas can attest to that.\r\n\r\nNow if you really want to think outside the box, here are some suggestions for a cheaper but still special wedding:\r\nHow About These Radical Ways To Save?\r\n\r\n#1 Go cultural.\r\nIf you have wedding traditions that involve the exchange of currency, cash or even cash equivalents such as gift cards, why not incorporate it in your event (see Money Dance)? It\u2019s been a boon to many couples I know.\r\n\r\n#2 Cut down on guests.\r\nThis is the easiest way to save money. Start cutting down your guest list liberally \u2014 in 5 years, you\u2019ll never see those co-workers again anyway. Make excuses that only close friends and family are invited. I\u2019ve been cut from many lists before and I understood.\r\n\r\n#3 Rent everything.\r\nGrooms and groomsmen rent their tuxedos, why not have the entire bridal party rent their clothing? Will you be willing to rent your own wedding dress? Rent a cake? This comes back to keeping an open mind!\r\n\r\n#4 Request contributions towards wedding accoutrements in lieu of gifts.\r\nHow about negotiating the gift of time, service or money towards your wedding event rather than actual material gifts from your friends and family? Some of them may want to pitch in to contribute for flowers, centerpieces, favors, food or even the honeymoon.\r\n\r\n#5 Peg your wedding on an off-day.\r\nShift your wedding schedule and try for the off-season or a week day. I\u2019d personally avoid bad weather months though just because a tornado over your wedding tent would *really suck*.\r\n\r\n#6 Use cardboard for part of your wedding cake.\r\nYou\u2019ve got a beautiful multi-tiered wedding cake so why not fake its bottom? I suggest this and many more wedding cake savings tips in this post.\r\n\r\n#7 Choose a free (or almost free) venue.\r\nHold your wedding in a park or the beach or somewhere you can celebrate without spending an arm or a leg. You can try convincing your favorite aunt to open her house to your wedding party.\r\n\r\n#8 Keep your entertainment simple.\r\nGet your talented relatives to line up and do a performance for you. Maybe have some younger folks come up with some numbers. We were dining at an Indian restaurant once and to our delight, there was a traditional Indian wedding taking place in a banquet hall next to our seats. I got to watch some cute little kids do some cultural (as well as modern) dance and song numbers to everyone\u2019s entertainment.\r\n\r\n#9 Use the internet!\r\nTry typing \u201ccheap wedding\u201d in the Google search box and be agog by the number of listings, tips, ideas, advice and products you are privy to by the click of a button. Research is king.\r\n\r\n#10 Delay the wedding.\r\nHow about this novel thought \u2014 plan your wedding once you\u2019ve built up enough savings to fund it? That\u2019s what we did. That\u2019s why it took a bit of time as well. It was all part of our big master plan to get married after 6 years of dating (and working at our careers) after which we took another 6 years to wait to have kids. By sacrificing our time, we were thus able to easily take care of the financial details of these events.\r\n\r\n#11 As a last resort, elope!\r\nJust a few months ago, a dear friend shocked us by saying she already got married. Was I slighted? Maybe just a little, but I understood. After the fact, she\u2019s now inviting us to a post-wedding party. Though I doubt money was the reason behind her stunt, I\u2019m sure she must\u2019ve still saved a bundle.\r\n\r\nThough some of these ideas may seem outrageous to you at first glance, I\u2019d say just give it a bit of time to sink in. You never know, it may not sound like such bad ideas after all if you see how much you can save from making some simple adjustments to your wedding plan.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://townsdelight.multiply.com/journal/item/8/Weddings_-_Money_Saving_Tips"},{"url":"http://townsdelight.multiply.com/journal?&page_start=20"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.thedigeratilife.com/blog/index.php/2008/06/23/wedding-costs-create-a-wedding-budget/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
