{"dmca":{"id":3033,"type":"Dmca","title":"Request fo Assistance","body":"To Whom It May Concern:\r\n\r\nFor several years I have been aware that the following two web site were out there is cyber space. They were originally created when we had another web site address. The addresses in question are:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.umsl.edu/~muns/city/BIZ3.HTM\r\n\r\nhttp://www.umsl.edu/~muns/city/index.html\r\n\r\nI have always felt that this has been the work of one of your talented students and that the system manager of your web site would eventually remove them from the UMSL.edu system, but to date that has not happened. My concern is that someone has taken copyrighted material changed a few names around by using strikeovers but it is very easy to see that the information concerns area businesses in the Hannibal area. We are very proud of our community and our businesses as I am sure you are proud of your institution and its history. There are other matters on these two sites that give me legal concern.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for you or the system manager to remove these two site from the UMSL web page system so that they will never appear again. I would appreciate it very much. I would also appreciate a reply to my request.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nLarry B.
