{"dmca":{"id":7959,"type":"Dmca","title":"Nextel Says No-No to Nudes","body":"Dear [private]:\r\n\r\nNextel Communications, Inc. (\"Nextel\") recently became aware of your registration and use of the above-referenced domain names.  \r\n\r\nAs you obviously know, Nextel is a leader in providing wireless telecommunications products and services throughout the world.  Nextel has used its famous NEXTEL mark in connection with telecommunications services since at least as early as 1988 and owns several United States federal trademark registrations for the mark NEXTEL and several registrations and applications for other NEXT-based marks.  Nextel has also invested substantially in advertising featuring its famous yellow-and-black color scheme.  As a result, the mark NEXTEL, other NEXT-based marks, and the yellow-and-black color scheme have become synonymous in the minds of consumers with the high quality of Nextel's goods and services.\r\n\r\nYour unauthorized registration and use of these domain names infringe our valuable trademark and trade dress rights and unfairly trade upon Nextel's fame and established goodwill.  Particularly in the case of the <nextelnudes.com> website, your use also tarnishes the goodwill associated with the mark.  The public is likely to mistakenly believe that the goods and services offered on your websites and other content on the websites emanates from, or is sponsored by or approved by Nextel. \r\n\r\nSuch confusion dilutes the strength and value of our trademark rights.  Your activity violates the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.S.C.A.
