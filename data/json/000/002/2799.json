{"dmca":{"id":2799,"type":"Dmca","title":"A Violinist.com Comment","body":"Dear [Private]- I am sending you an email as I do not have your mailing\r\naddress. I am an attorney writing on behalf of [Private]. He has\r\ncalled my attention to the material appearing on the Discussion Board of\r\nyour website. The vitrioloic message from [Private] is slanderous\r\nand defamatory and completely inappropriate for inclusion on your\r\nDiscussion Board. [Private] is embitterred by the fact that [Private] found it necessary to expell him from his program. [Private] is\r\ndetermining what legal action he may take for the damages inflicted by\r\nthis diatribe on his music institute. I would respectfully suggest that\r\nyou exercise reasonable editorial discretion as to the material you permit\r\nto appear on your site's Discussion Board. I am specifically requesting\r\nthat the discussion of [Private] be deleted. As it currently stands,\r\nif you \"Google\" [Private], the first reference that appears is your\r\nDiscussion Board. This has the potential for inflicting serious damages on\r\n[Private] and his universally acclaimed summer Institute. I would trust\r\nthat, upon reflection, you would agree that this kind of material reflects\r\nadversely on your site, as well. I f you wish to discuss this, I can be\r\nreached at [Private]. Thank you.
