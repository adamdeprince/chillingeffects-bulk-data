Pursuant to the Acceptable User \r\n> Policy posted on ThePlanet.com, we write concerning trademark and \r\n> copyright infringement of Chancery Software's proprietary rights on \r\n> the Site.\r\n> According to enom.com, the URL reportedly redirects to IP address \r\n> 70.84.252.218, which according to NetworkSolutions' Who-is record is \r\n> hosted by ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc. Please advise us if \r\n> this information is not correct.\r\n> Chancery Software is the owner of the trademarks SMS, Design of a \r\n> Graduation Cap and CHANCERY STUDENT MANAGEMENT SOLUTION, all which are \r\n> being used on the Site without Chancery Software's permission. The SMS \r\n> mark is the subject of US federal trademark Registration No. 2872872 \r\n> for the mark CHANCERY SMS covering a broad range of class 9 education \r\n> software and class 42 computer and technical support services.\r\n> Chancery Software is also the owner of the mark CHANCERY STUDENT \r\n> MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, also the subject of US federal Registration Nos.\r\n> 2840801 and 2845468. All of these marks, including the marks SMS and \r\n> Design of a Graduation Cap are prominently featured on my client's web \r\n> site and are protected under US trademark and copyright laws. Please \r\n> see www.chancery.com and http://www.chancery.com/prod_sms.html.\r\n> Chancery Software is an award-winning provider of education-related \r\n> software and its Chancery SMS product is very well known in the \r\n> education industry. While we understand that there is a narrow defense \r\n> to trademark infringement under the First Amendment recognizing free \r\n> speech, the Site goes beyond this defense when it uses Chancery \r\n> Software's distinctive logos and stylized marks without its \r\n> permission. Clearly, this company has encountered other copyright \r\n> infringement issues as self-reported on the Site. See \r\n> http://www.smsoops.com/cartoons/index.htm.\r\n\r\n> Pursuant to your authority under the Acceptable User Policy, we \r\n> request that you suspend hosting for this web site any associated \r\n> email addresses based on a clear infringement of Chancery Software's \r\n> trademark rights and copyright.\r\n> We also think it is worth noting that it appears that the owner of the \r\n> URL extensively uses the Snoopy character, depictions and the Snoopy \r\n> theme song on the Site, presumably without permission from the \r\n> appropriate owner. Please see www.smsoops.com.\r\n> Please do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions.\r\n> Otherwise, we look forward to your response to our inquiry and \r\n> request.
