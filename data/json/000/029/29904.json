Our site is\r\navailable on the Internet at http://www.amazingcounters.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn particular, the homepage http://www.thefreehitcounter.com has the\r\nbulleted list and paragraph in the \"Web Counters Information\" section\r\nthat is copied from our site with minor modifications.  The questions\r\nand answers in the Help page http://www.thefreehitcounter.com/help.php\r\nare copied from our site with minor modifications.  The text on the sign\r\nup / counter pages (http://www.thefreehitcounter.com/hit-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/animal-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/art-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/sports-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/odometer-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/tech-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/cool.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/colorful-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/language-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/ocassion-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/lcd-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/scary-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/wacky-counter.php,\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/basic-counter.php and\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/creative-counter.php) is copied from\r\nour site with minor modifications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe text paragraph at the top of\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/advertise.php is copied from our site\r\nwith minor modifications.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe above urls include virtually every page of their site.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to the copied text, our original copyrighted counter styles\r\n(graphic images) have been copied directly without modification as well.\r\nThese are relatively easy to identify compared to styles they have that\r\nwere not copied from us, because they currently show the same unique\r\nsequence of numbers (92031475) used by our site and their other styles\r\nuse the standard sequence (0123456789).  Of particular note, most of the\r\nimages on http://www.thefreehitcounter.com/animal-counter.php and\r\nhttp://www.thefreehitcounter.com/sports-counter.php are ones that have\r\nbeen copied without permission from our site.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThere are also high level indications that the entire site was based on\r\nour design, with some subsequent modification.  For example, their use\r\nof an introductory paragraph, the all upper case SAMPLE WEB COUNTERS,\r\nthe bulleted list, etc. are all taken from our unique design.  Likewise,\r\nthey use very similar categorization of counter styles as ours, which no\r\nother site has, including very unique category designations like\r\n\"Creative\", \"Colorful\", \"Artistic\", \"Scary\", \"Weird and Wacky\", etc.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, yourhitcounter.com contains very similar instances of\r\ncopyright infringmenet.  Of particular note are the content of the FAQ\r\npage (http://www.yourhitcounter.com/help.php) and the counter style\r\ngraphic images with the 92031475 sequence on\r\nhttp://www.yourhitcounter.com/animal-counter.php and\r\nhttp://www.yourhitcounter.com/sports-counter.php.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt is requested that you expeditiously remove or disable access to the\r\nmaterial that is infringing on our copyrights.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials\r\ndescribed above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized\r\nby the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the\r\nnotification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is\r\nallegedly infringed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael Kovarik\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAmazingCounters.com\r\n\r\nsupport@amazingcounters.com\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-06-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-06-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"AmazingCounters.com","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
