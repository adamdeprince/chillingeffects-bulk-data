Informing subscribers and account\r\nholders of acts of infringement is a crucial element to a policy\r\nproviding for the termination of repeat infringers.\r\n\r\nThis letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of TITAN Media's\r\nlegal position, nor is it a waiver of any of our rights and/or remedies\r\nin this or any other matter, all of which are expressly reserved.
