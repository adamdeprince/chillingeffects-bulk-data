The domain is pureserendipity.com. I am the former\r\nowner of the domain, and it appears that someone has recently bought it\r\nand reposted all of my old personal website content back onto it. As you\r\ncan see, the person has even posted my email address back onto the site.\r\nThe entirety of the content on that domain right now belongs to me. \r\n\r\nIt is my good faith belief that the use of this material has not been\r\nauthorized by me in any way. I assert that the information in this\r\nnotification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that that I am\r\nthe owner of this intellectual property, and thus authorized to act on\r\nan exclusive right that it is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nI ask that you please remove this content from pureserendipity.com\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nKelly Green (I certify that this is an electronic signature)\r\n936 Heights Blvd. Apt. #3\r\nHouston, TX 77008\r\nCell phone - 832-434-1719\r\nEmail: kelly_484@yahoo.com","date_sent":"2006-11-29T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-11-29T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Kelly Green","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
