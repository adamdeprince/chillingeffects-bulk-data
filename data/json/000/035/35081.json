This scrupuless webmaster is sending spambots out\r\nto mine other website's copyright protected content and source codes and\r\nplacing it on his website. He is doing this for the sole purpose of\r\nstealing our traffic and search engine rankings. Some of my website's\r\ncontent, including my name (and many others) can be found on the\r\nfollowing page:  \r\n \r\nhttp://www.123-paintballs.com/corporate-events/magician-corporate-event.\r\nhtml. \r\n \r\nI am in no way affiliated with this website, nor has permission been\r\never been granted to them to use my name or my website content on their\r\nwebsite. I have emailed the webmaster repeatedly, requesting that my\r\nname and content be removed immediately and he blatantly refuses to do\r\nso. Additionally, he has threatened to create additional pages just to\r\ndephile my name and character now (I would be happy to send you that\r\nemail at your request)! I have contacted some of the other websites that\r\nhe is stealing content from and they are not happy. One of them\r\n(AllTimeFavorites.com) notified me that they discovered the webmaster\r\nisn't even using his real name, address or state with his registrar\r\n(BLACK ICE DOMAINS, INC). This horribly poor quality website is full of\r\nnothing but irrelevant, misleading, stolen content, typos,\r\nmis-spellings, improper grammer and jibberish. There are literally\r\nhundreds of pages of stolen content! As i'm sure you know, these sorts\r\nof practices could possi!\r\n bly result in other website's (including your own) eventually being\r\nbanned and/or penalized by the search engines.  \r\n \r\nIf you folks could please see that my name and content are removed from\r\nthis website immediately, it would be very much appreciated. Thank you\r\nfor your time and please have a great day! \r\n \r\nSincerely,\r\nAedryan Methyus\r\nwww.methyus.com\r\nMIME element (text/html)\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN\">\r\n<HTML><HEAD> <META http-equiv=Content-Type content=\"text/html;\r\ncharset=iso-8859-1\"> <META content=\"MSHTML 6.00.2900.2963\"\r\nname=GENERATOR> <STYLE></STYLE> </HEAD> <BODY bgColor=#ffffff>\r\n<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2> <DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>To Whom It\r\nMay Concern,</FONT></DIV> <DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I recently\r\ndiscovered a website named <A href=\"\">www.123-paintballs.com</A>, which\r\nis hosted by you folks.
