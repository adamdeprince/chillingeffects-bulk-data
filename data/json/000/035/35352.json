Last week\r\nwe withdrew our complaint to you after the site administrator promised to\r\nremove the infringements from his site; I checked back this morning to find\r\nthe same issues unchanged.  The infringements are as follows:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*     Offering links to live F1 streams\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*     Offering static images regularly updated from the official live TV\r\nfeed\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*     Offering live timing data\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGiven the situation where he has promised to act, taken partial action and\r\nthen proceeded to repeat the offence we feel we must now contact yourselves\r\nand ask for the site to be blocked, at least until it can be shown to be\r\nclean of any infringing material.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow you will find a copy of the relevant cease and desist letter:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDear Sirs\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFormula One Administration Limited (\"FOA\") has the exclusive right to\r\ncommercially exploit the FIA Formula One World Championship (\"the\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nChampionship\") including, but not limited to, all moving images, other\r\naudio/video content, timing data and results.
