I have contacted Mr. Kennedy on numerous occasions requesting\r\nthat this material be taken down and he has plainly refused to do so.\r\n\r\nI am currently in the process of seeking legal council to remedy this\r\nproblem, however I would like to resolve the matter in the quickest and most\r\nefficient manner possible. I therefore request that you contact Mr. Kennedy\r\nand have him remove the offending material.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the page involved is:\r\nhttp://bassgirls.com/bass_griffinivy.htm\r\n\r\nincluding the personal information listed on the page.\r\n\r\nThe copyrighted material is the following photograph being used against my\r\nwishes:\r\nhttp://bassgirls.com/images/bass_griffinivy01.jpg\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at your earliest convenience to inform me as to how you\r\nare planning to resolve the matter.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your assistance,\r\n\r\nIvana Vujic\r\nvujicivana@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\nRFC822 HEADERS:\r\nReceived: from localhost ([127.0.0.1] helo=[216.185.111.52])\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com (envelope-from\r\nabuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com)\r\n        with esmtp (Exim)\r\n        id 1F7NF0-0005GL-1V; Thu, 09 Feb 2006 19:38:30 -0600\r\nReceived: from mx01 ([172.16.214.180] helo=mx01.filter.theplanet.com)\r\n        by mail.theplanet.com (envelope-from vujicivana@gmail.com)\r\n        with esmtps (TLSv1:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:256) (Exim) id\r\n1F7NEy-0005G7-AD\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Thu, 09 Feb 2006 19:38:28 -0600\r\nReceived: from wproxy.gmail.com ([64.233.184.199])\r\n        by mx01.filter.theplanet.com (envelope-from vujicivana@gmail.com)\r\n        with esmtp (Exim) id 1F7NEw-0004T4-V7\r\n        for abuse@theplanet.com; Thu, 09 Feb 2006 19:38:28 -0600\r\nReceived: by wproxy.gmail.com with SMTP id i23so250920wra\r\n        for <abuse@theplanet.com>; Thu, 09 Feb 2006 17:38:26 -0800 (PST)\r\nReceived: by 10.65.210.6 with SMTP id m6mr266114qbq;\r\n        Thu, 09 Feb 2006 17:38:26 -0800 (PST)\r\nReceived: by 10.65.15.5 with HTTP; Thu, 9 Feb 2006 17:38:26 -0800 (PST)\r\nMessage-ID: <42066c330602091738p4e33a017qb60474f92e24ae53@mail.gmail.com>\r\nDate: Thu, 9 Feb 2006 20:38:26 -0500\r\nFrom: Ivana Vujic <vujicivana@gmail.com>\r\nTo: sales@theplanet.com\r\nMIME-Version: 1.0\r\nContent-Type: multipart/alternative; \r\n        boundary=\"----=_Part_15122_2289812.1139535506110\"\r\nReceived-SPF: pass (mx01.filter.theplanet.com: domain of gmail.com\r\ndesignates\r\n        64.233.184.199 as permitted sender) client-ip=64.233.184.199;\r\n        envelope-from=vujicivana@gmail.com; helo=wproxy.gmail.com;\r\nX-Spam-Level: ---------------------------------------------------\r\nX-Spam-Score: -101.2\r\nCc: abuse@theplanet.com\r\nSubject: [ABUSE] abuse\r\nX-BeenThere: abuse@lists.theplanet.com\r\nX-Mailman-Version: 2.1.7\r\nPrecedence: list\r\nList-Id: <abuse.lists.theplanet.com>\r\nList-Unsubscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=unsubscribe>\r\nList-Post: <mailto:abuse@lists.theplanet.com>\r\nList-Help: <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=help>\r\nList-Subscribe: <http://lists.theplanet.com/mailman/listinfo/abuse>,\r\n        <mailto:abuse-request@lists.theplanet.com?subject=subscribe>\r\nSender: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\nErrors-To: abuse-bounces@lists.theplanet.com\r\n","date_sent":"2006-02-10T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-02-10T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Ivana Vujic","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
