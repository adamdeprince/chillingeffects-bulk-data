These registered marks include, among others, the 'AAA' mark, Triple A and the AAA oval logo design.\r\n\r\n       Unauthorized businesses that use the American Automobile Association's designations, or confusingly similar designations, in conjunction with the sale of their own products and services may mislead consumers who are likely to confuse those products and services with those offered or approved by the American Automobile Association.  Such unauthorized use of the American Automobile Association","date_sent":"2007-08-23T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-08-23T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"AAA America Qutomobile Association","recipient_name":"www.aaacreditrepair.org","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
