The site carries articles, illustrations, logos,\r\ncartoons and other material that are all copyrighted and he has no\r\npermission to use them. The origin of all of this material is from a\r\nsimilarly named site: www.ovimagazine.com.\r\n\r\nYour site requests the following six items:\r\n\r\n1. Please find attached an electronic signature of the person\r\n(\"Complaining Party\") authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an\r\nexclusive right that is claimed to be infringed.\r\n\r\n2. The entire site is filled with copyrighted material and he has\r\nchanged the author names on all of Asa Butcher and Thanos Kalamidas' \r\nwork to his own (Oliver H.), but the links still go to our names! Beware\r\nof any confusion because he has also created a web domain that is almost\r\nthe same as our magazine. Here is a representative list of multiple\r\ncopyrighted works that have been infringed at www.theovimagazine.com -\r\nit is nowhere near the full list:\r\n\r\nEditorial thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/intro/editorials/thanoskalamidas/intro-16/\r\n\r\nPaternity leave left asa butcher\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/horizones/asabutcher/left/\r\n\r\nis homosexuality a disease?\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/horizones/asabutcher\r\n\r\nCopycat politics thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/iformat/thanoskalamidas/copy\r\n/\r\n\r\nNever trust the perfe thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/iformat/thanoskalamidas/finl\r\nand/\r\n\r\nFrench copycats thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/iformat/thanoskalamidas/fren\r\nch/\r\n\r\nThe Baltic, Bob and a boat\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/ikritic/asabutcher/baltic/\r\n\r\nBeing Zidane thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/sports/thanoskalamidas/zidan\r\ne/\r\n\r\nCopy about cats asa butcher\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/fart/asabutcher/cats/\r\n\r\nCopycat education models thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/horizones/thanoskalamidas/ed\r\nucation/\r\n\r\nMTV Finland thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/ikritic/thanoskalamidas/mtv/\r\n\r\nCinematic copycat asa butcher\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/fart/asabutcher/cinematic/\r\n\r\nCopycat politics thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/iformat/thanoskalamidas/copy\r\n/\r\n\r\nNever trust the perfe thanos kalamidas\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/ifo\r\n\r\nThis article:\r\nParanoid passengers asa butcher\r\nhttp://theovimagazine.com/archives/issue-16/iformat/asabutcher/paranoid/\r\n\r\n...was written by me and actually translated into Finnish three months\r\nago for a print publication in Finland. The editor can verify. In\r\naddition, we have over forty contributors who will also vouch for us. We\r\nhave the original PDF files too, we have all the originals.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. You ask for identification of the material that is claimed to be\r\ninfringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be\r\nremoved or access to which is to be disabled. As I mentioned before, the\r\nentire website has copyrighted material, including the photographs,\r\ncovers, cartoons and radio shows. The site owner has none of the\r\noriginal artwork, which we do, and he does not have permission to use\r\nthe work of any of the contributors, which we do. You might want to look\r\nat the archives and ask why he has no content, except the PDFs, from the\r\nfirst issues, by the way, we do have everything including the photos.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\nAdministrative Contact:\r\nHerrmann, Oliver oli089@gmx.de\r\nCirc.del Robalo788 A7,\r\nFrac Los Mangos, Col.Versalles\r\nPuerto Vallarta, Jalisco 48310\r\nMexico\r\n+52 322 224 6160\r\n\r\nDomain servers in listed order:\r\nNS1.WEXICO.COM\r\nNS2.WEXICO.COM\r\n\r\nhttp://who.godaddy.com/whois.aspx?domain=theovimagazine.com&prog_id=goda\r\nddy\r\nshows that the same person operates the site via the wexico.com name.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.
