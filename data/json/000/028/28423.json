Please review the attached\r\nletter.  It should be readily obvious that the .net is a clone of our\r\nwebsite www.tigerbrokerage.com <http://www.tigerbrokerage.com/>\r\n(.com).  The only difference is an additional tab on job opportunities.\r\nThey are even using our biographies and pictures.  People pay them money\r\nin advance to apply for a financial management position.  This is an\r\nobvious scam.  We have no business outside the U.S. nor any financial\r\nmanagement positions.  In addition to talking with our corporate\r\nattorney about this problem,  we have notified the Federal Trade\r\nCommission, the FBI, and the Secret Service.  The FBI has set up a file\r\non this case.  Please let me know how you want to proceed as niave\r\npeople are losing money on this illegal activity.  \r\n \r\nEd Towers\r\n \r\nEdward W.
