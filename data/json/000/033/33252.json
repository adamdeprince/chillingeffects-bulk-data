The below is to help\r\nyou take appropriate action.  The discussion forum has been warned of\r\nthe legal implications, but have chosen to do nothing thusfar. \r\n \r\n \r\nhttp://www.menshealth.com.ph is hosted on a server housed by your\r\nfacility.   \r\n \r\nThe following thread contains libelous statments against employees of a\r\ncompany who stand to lose their job due to insubordination, not to\r\nmention the insinuation of intolerance of their boss if what is said led\r\nto their termination.  The individual possibly made the statement\r\nbecause he partially knows the general company policy, and it has caused\r\ngreat distress to the individuals whose names have been mentioned. \r\n \r\nhttp://www.menshealth.com.ph/board/index.php?topic=183.15 \r\n \r\n \r\nAnother thread makes defamatory and racist statements against an\r\nindividual and others due to personal issues.  Again, the forum is\r\ndegenerating from a positive into a statement on degeneracy.  Most of\r\nthe moderators and board owners know the individuals in question, yet\r\nthey ignore the pleas of these defamatory statements made by the board\r\nmember LeePriest to go on, after having been given plenty of time to\r\ndelete the inflammatory thread. \r\n \r\nHere is a copy of the letter requesting stoppage of a degenerate\r\nsituation: \r\n \r\nActually I'll wait until Monday at 6pm for you to resolve this since I\r\nsuppose it wouldn't be fair to take action on the weekend if none of you\r\nare there to receive the message on this situation.  To be clear, I'm\r\nnot making threats against you.  But I cannot allow LeePriest to keep\r\nthis up.  We know his full name, phone number, company address, etc, but\r\nwe don't do the same to him.  What you are seeing is a former member who\r\ngot banned because he was caught watching pornography on his laptop PC\r\nin our locker room.  The result is that he takes it to your forum for\r\nhis \"revenge\".  I know I would not allow such behavior if I was a\r\nmoderator (not that I'm asking to be one here).  I don't want to be\r\naccused of anymore vested interest or bias than I already receive, no\r\nmatter how transparent I try to be. \r\n \r\nBesides libel, now it's clear that racism is a motive using the name of\r\nan individual.  I hate to have to be like this, but these posts of\r\nLeePriest will be forwarded to The Planet if action is not taken.\r\nScreenshots exist from the last time he did it as well as this time and\r\nboth will be sent.  I warned you all that he would do it again.  You\r\nneed to ban him, or at least make it clear to him that he is going above\r\nand beyond in his violations of board policy, not to mention common\r\ndecency.  To debate via handle is one thing.  To libel and make racist\r\nstatements is another using the names of prominant individuals in the\r\nindustry.  Men's Health only stands to lose by having people like him\r\naround.  The ironic thing is that he'd never read Men's Health.  Flex\r\nand Muscle and Fitness are all he knows. \r\n \r\n\"Arcee, when Mr. Jason Postulka is not around, do bodybuilding movements\r\nand isolation exercise, so as Aga, now what? anyways, LeePriest stands\r\nfor everyone, or on my side... trusted person\"s\" know these password...\r\nwell this is the former guy that the white man banned in Eclipse... you\r\nare good with saying things up, let's just face in any competition these\r\napril and may, just send me a PM. then speak out after a competition.\" ","date_sent":"2007-01-08T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-08T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"pltnav@Safe-mail.net","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
