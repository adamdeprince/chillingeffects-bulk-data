These sites are offering direct links to files containing sound\nrecordings for other users to download by such artists known as 3 Doors\nDown, Foo Fighters, Incubus, Kelly Clarkson, and Limp Bizkit.  These\nrecordings are owned by one of our member companies and have not been\nauthorized for this kind of use.
