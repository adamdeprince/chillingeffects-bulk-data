We sent a TM Request letter about 10 days ago and asked for a reply.  It looks like a headless group.  Should I go ahead and remove them from freecycle.org and set up a new local group?  Or do you want to try to contact them first?  I am honestly hoping they see this and contact me, but we can't be sure that they will.\r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\nJeanette\r\nFreecycle(TM) Trademark Representative\r\ntrademark1@freecycle.org\r\n \r\n___________________________________________________\r\nCopyright ","date_sent":"2006-05-13T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-05-13T04:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Freecycle(TM) Trademark Representative\" <trademark1@freecycle.org>","recipient_name":"Columbia City Freecycle","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
