(?IPOWERWEB?).  IPOWERWEB owns the rights\r\nto use the trademarks/service marks/trade names and copyrights of the name\r\nIPOWERWEB or derivative thereof.  Please direct all future inquiries and\r\ncorrespondence to the undersigned only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has come to our client's attention that you and/or your business has\r\nparticipated in and caused or authorized the making and distribution of\r\ncertain derivative trademarks/service marks/trade names, copyrighted pages\r\nor portions owned or controlled or created solely by our client, and\r\nknowingly permitted and encouraged the downloading of such copies and\r\nportions with respect to several pages on the Internet/World Wide Web (i.e.,\r\nIPOWERWEB2).  Your company has not obtained authority from IPOWERWEB to use\r\nany of its trademarks/service marks/trade names and copyrighted materials or\r\nderivatives thereof and is in violation of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur client's trademarks/service marks, trade name and copyrighted materials\r\nwere created solely by our client and are protected by copyright and\r\ntrademark laws.  Your use of our client?s trademarks/service marks, trade\r\nname directly violates the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour company should have no desire to confuse existing or potential patrons\r\nas to the source, origin, and quality of services or to trade upon the\r\ngoodwill of our client.  However, you must be aware that your use of our\r\nclient's trademarks/service marks, trade name and copyrighted materials are\r\nlikely to cause and has caused confusion or deception or mistake, or a\r\ncombination thereof among patrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur client believes that your continued use of its trademarks/service marks,\r\ntrade name and copyrighted materials in connection with your business will\r\nresult and has resulted in the dilution and loss of our client's goodwill,\r\nthereby violating enforceable copyright rights acquired by our client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased upon the nature and extent of your duplication of our client's\r\ntrademarks/service marks, trade name and copyrighted materials, my client\r\ncan only conclude that it was your intention to deliberately violate the\r\nrights of our client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in order to protect our client's rights, IPOWERWEB hereby\r\ndemands that you immediately cease and desist from any and all further\r\nduplication or use of the its trademarks/service marks, trade name and\r\ncopyrighted materials or any derivative trade name or marks thereof,\r\ncopyrighted materials and all other unlicensed and infringing activities in\r\nconnection with your business conducted on the Internet/World Wide Web.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time and for purposes of settlement only, our client demands written\r\nassurance that you will stop all infringing activities.\r\nAccordingly, we suggest that you promptly contact my office upon receipt of\r\nthis letter to confirm that the violations will stop.  If you provide\r\nwritten assurance that you will not continue to use the trademark/service\r\nmark/trade name or any confusingly similar mark or name or any copyrighted\r\nmaterials, and remove the infringing materials from your website, my client\r\nwill consider matter closed.  However, if the violations do not cease we\r\nwill have no other alternative but to seek any and all legal remedies\r\navailable, including seeking injunctive relief and attorneys fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease respond to this letter immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also advise you that this letter is written without prejudice to all the\r\nrights and remedies our client may have at law or in equity, all being\r\nhereby reserved on its behalf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost seriously,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristopher Gonzalez\r\n\r\nGeneral Counsel\r\n\r\nIPOWERWEB, INC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n********************************************\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis email message, its contents and any attachments hereto, are for the\r\nsole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and\r\nprivileged information.
