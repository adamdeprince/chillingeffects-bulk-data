Your site is ambiguous in its intent.\r\nExcept for using the language that anyone listed on your website\r\ncomes under a legal term of \"Criminal.\" This sort of language is\r\nlibelous to our company. Our email is sent out not only in a\r\nperfectly legal fashion, but a personal and professional format. To\r\nmake things brief, your listing our company as a criminal entity on\r\nyour website defames us and our organization. This email is a\r\nnotification to the addressee to cease and desist the publication of\r\nour website address, company name, and any reference to Internet\r\nAdvancement under a false heading. \r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with the legal definitions of spam or UCE and\r\nwould like to take a refresher course, I've prepared these links\r\noutlining the laws that apply to Washington State Entities.\r\n\r\n- --Orion\r\n\r\nRCW 19.190.030\r\nUnpermitted or misleading electronic mail -- Violation of consumer\r\nprotection act.\r\n(1) It is a violation of the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86\r\nRCW, to conspire with another person to initiate the transmission or\r\nto initiate the transmission of a commercial electronic mail message\r\nthat:\r\n     (a) Uses a third party's internet domain name without permission\r\nof the third party, or otherwise misrepresents or obscures any\r\ninformation in identifying the point of origin or the transmission\r\npath of a commercial electronic mail message; or\r\n\r\n     (b) Contains false or misleading information in the subject\r\nline.\r\n\r\n     (2) It is a violation of the consumer protection act, chapter\r\n19.86 RCW, to assist in the transmission of a commercial electronic\r\nmail message, when the person providing the assistance knows, or\r\nconsciously avoids knowing, that the initiator of the commercial\r\nelectronic mail message is engaged, or intends to engage, in any act\r\nor practice that violates the consumer protection act.\r\n\r\n     (3) The legislature finds that the practices covered by this\r\nchapter are matters vitally affecting the public interest for the\r\npurpose of applying the consumer protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. A\r\nviolation of this chapter is not reasonable in relation to the\r\ndevelopment and preservation of business and is an unfair or\r\ndeceptive act in trade or commerce and an unfair method of\r\ncompetition for the purpose of applying the consumer protection act,\r\nchapter 19.86 RCW.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1999 c 289 ? 3; 1998 c 149 ? 4.]\r\n\r\nRCW 19.190.020\r\nUnpermitted or misleading electronic mail -- Prohibition.\r\n(1) No person may initiate the transmission, conspire with another to\r\ninitiate the transmission, or assist the transmission, of a\r\ncommercial electronic mail message from a computer located in\r\nWashington or to an electronic mail address that the sender knows, or\r\nhas reason to know, is held by a Washington resident that:\r\n     (a) Uses a third party's internet domain name without permission\r\nof the third party, or otherwise misrepresents or obscures any\r\ninformation in identifying the point of origin or the transmission\r\npath of a commercial electronic mail message; or\r\n\r\n     (b) Contains false or misleading information in the subject\r\nline.\r\n\r\n     (2) For purposes of this section, a person knows that the\r\nintended recipient of a commercial electronic mail message is a\r\nWashington resident if that information is available, upon request,\r\nfrom the registrant of the internet domain name contained in the\r\nrecipient's electronic mail address.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1999 c 289 ? 2; 1998 c 149 ? 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRCW 19.190.050\r\nBlocking of commercial electronic mail by interactive computer\r\nservice -- Immunity from liability.\r\n(1) An interactive computer service may, upon its own initiative,\r\nblock the receipt or transmission through its service of any\r\ncommercial electronic mail that it reasonably believes is, or will\r\nbe, sent in violation of this chapter.\r\n     (2) No interactive computer service may be held liable for any\r\naction voluntarily taken in good faith to block the receipt or\r\ntransmission through its service of any commercial electronic mail\r\nwhich it reasonably believes is, or will be, sent in violation of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1998 c 149 ? 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n- -----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: [Private][mailto:[private]@shrednow.com]\r\nSent: Wednesday, July 02, 2003 1:06 PM\r\nTo: [Private]@internetadvancement.com\r\nSubject: Re: Spam Criminals Feedback\r\n\r\n\r\nOrion,\r\n\r\nI will be glad to remove you from the Spam Criminals list as long as \r\nyou follow the instructions at \r\nhttp://www.shrednow.com/spamcrime/spammeroff.html .\r\n\r\nYour organization sent me unsolicited commercial email, which is my \r\n(and many others') definition of spam.
