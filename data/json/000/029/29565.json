Currently, you are hosting a site that is stealing my company's web\r\nsite and trying to sell ads from it. The site you are hosting is\r\nhttp://www.fsmse.com/ . The people who say they own this site are actually\r\nstealing the form and contents from my company's www.mse-ta.com\r\n<http://www.mse-ta.com> site. They are trying to get other companies to post\r\nadverts and pay them the money. One such agency, adtegrity, researched their\r\nrequest and found the site to be false and did not accept the site. However,\r\nit looks like Yahoo is allowing ads to be posted. This fsmse.com site is\r\nillegally representing themselves as MSE.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what I can do to get you to shut these people down! I\r\nwould like to maintain the integrity of both theplanet and MSE.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have been able to get only the information below - (bogus I am\r\nsure). Please let me know that you can stop this illegal activity. Thank you\r\n\r\nPrefix: Mr.\r\n\r\nFirst Name: Joan\r\n\r\nLast Name: Nixon\r\n\r\nTitle: Welcome to MSE\r\n\r\nCompany: MSE Technology Applications Inc.\r\n\r\nAddress 1: 3824 Kingston St.\r\nAddress 2:\r\n\r\nCity: Reno\r\n\r\nState/Province: NJ\r\n\r\nZip/Postal Code: 89502\r\n\r\nCountry: United States\r\n\r\nPhone: 702-586-1018\r\n\r\nFax: 702-586-1018\r\n\r\nEmail: admin@fsmse.com\r\n\r\nThese people are misrepresenting themselves as MSE and they are not!.\r\nThey are using my company and your company to illegally gain money.
