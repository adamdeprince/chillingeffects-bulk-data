As a  \r\npart of that operation they are using images and demo sites which they  \r\ndo not have the right to use.\r\n\r\nSpecific Details:\r\n\r\nThe following images are stolen - these images were created by myself:\r\nStolen Images:\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/11695754631168809416asmonitor.g\r\nif\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/11695755001168809681Autosurf.gi\r\nf\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/11695756461168809847CCscript.gi\r\nf\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/11695759961168810040millpix.gif\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/11695761111168810145ptrmonitor.\r\ngif\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/items_images/1169587775ddddddd.gif\r\n\r\nAll of them can be found on our own site, at http://scripts-r-us.com\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com/shop/index.php?cPath=1_98\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com/shop/index.php?cPath=1_89\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com/shop/index.php?cPath=1_46\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com/shop/index.php?cPath=1_92\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com/shop/index.php?cPath=1_104\r\n\r\nYou can see from the following pages they are linking to demo copies  \r\nof scripts installed on sub-domains at our site :\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=38 (Randomizer Demo)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=36 (PTR Monitor)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=33 (Million Pixels 3)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=25 (Cash Crusader)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=23 (Autosurf)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=22 (Autosurf Monitor)\r\nhttp://www.crazimillion.com/ViewItem.php?ItemID=110 (TEIAB)\r\n\r\nAll of the above scripts are licensed for sale by resellers only, at  \r\nminimum retail prices far higher than the prices offered by this site.  \r\n  I am personally in contact with the authors of all of these scripts  \r\nover this issue.\r\n\r\nAlso of note is that when I started compiling information for this  \r\nemail, the site was hosted on a server with ThePlanet.  Now I see the  \r\nDNS has been updated today to your server.\r\n\r\nI urge you to take action to close down this site immediately.  If  \r\nthere is anything further I can do in terms of providing further  \r\nevidence, such as source files for the images, or contact details of  \r\nthe script authors, please let me know.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the discussion of the script piracy is incidental to  \r\nthe primary claim of copyright violation, simply because I do not  \r\npersonally hold copyright on the scripts.  I do however claim  \r\ncopyright on the images, and the designs of the demo sites being used  \r\n- I have contacted the software authors and suggested they contact you  \r\non their own behalf.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I hereby warrant that the information in this  \r\nnotification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, state that I  \r\nam the owner, of an exclusive right that has been infringed.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nKevin Martin\r\nSales Support,\r\nGo-Mama-Hosting.com / Scripts-R-Us.com\r\nadmin@go-mama-hosting.com\r\nhttp://www.go-mama-hosting.com\r\nhttp://scripts-r-us.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-02-01T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-01T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Kevin Martin","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
