In order to display the Fixture Lists you\r\nmust either obtain the necessary license from Football DataCo\r\n(dfolker@football-dataco.com) or be an officially nominated fanzine for\r\nyour chosen club. If you are not nominated as the official club fanzine\r\nand you do not wish to purchase a fixture license you can post a link to\r\nyour club official site.\r\n\r\nWithout nominated fanzine status or a license there is no provision for\r\nany fixture to appear in advance of the match being played. However, if\r\nthere is an editorial preview of the next upcoming match in which the\r\nfixture is mentioned then this is unlikely to be objected to, provided\r\nthis is done in a clearly editorial form. Mentioning more than one\r\nfixture would not be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormal Declaration\r\n\r\n1.
