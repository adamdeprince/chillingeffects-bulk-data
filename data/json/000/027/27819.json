Water, inc. is the owner of the Everhot \u00ae, Evercold\u00ae, \r\nEverbrew\u00ae, Enviropure\u00ae, Navinet\u00ae and Water, inc \u00ae trademarks and \r\nassociated domain names. I have attempted to remove this infraction by \r\ndelivering two notifications of Cease and Desist to the e-mail of record \r\nhowever the domain owner refuses to remove the infraction.  \r\n \r\nThe domain owner of this site is deliberately trying to cause customer \r\nconfusion by using Water, inc.'s trademarks to divert web traffic away \r\nfrom Water, inc's website at www.waterinc.com. This action constitutes \r\ntrademark infringement and unfair competition. I am therefore asking for \r\nyour assistance in having the domain owner remove all references to \r\nWater, inc.'s trademarks from their site. I truly appreciate your \r\nco-operation in this matter and hope to hear from you at your earliest \r\nconvenience.  \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\n \r\nTrademark Department \r\nWater, inc. \r\nLegal Administrator <administrator-106@legal-notification.com> \r\n[IFID:2H8J75] ","date_sent":"2007-03-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-03-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Water, Inc","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
