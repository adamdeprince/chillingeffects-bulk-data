Rolls-Royce has a long, glorious history of experimental cars. The  \nfirst one from the renowned house was a 1919 Silver Ghost test bed, chassis  \nnumber 1EX, and the latest is the 102EX, a battery-electric version of the  \ncurrent Phantom. The 10EX, which is up for grabs, is one of the most  \nsignificant Rolls-Royce experimental cars and was built in late 1925.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://carsbitblogsport.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"},{"url":"http://recingcarspotblogs.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"},{"url":"http://topgearnew.blogspot.com/2011/05/1926-rolls-royce-experimental-sports.html"}],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
