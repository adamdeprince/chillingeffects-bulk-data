Here is a portion of my original content:\r\n\r\nUse these five tips for reducing stress to improve your mental game on the golf course. When you do, you\u2019ll find that you will relax and enjoy your game more.\r\n\r\n1. Breathe\r\nThis is one of the simplest tips for reducing stress. Many athletes never bother to think about their breath. This is a mistake, because your breathing is closely tied both to your mental state and to the way your body moves. Snipers in the military have long been trained to control their breath in order to minimize the effects their involuntary body movements have on a shot over a long distance. The same concept applies to golf.\r\nIf you find yourself getting stressed out over your game, it\u2019s only likely to lead to a downward spiral. Stop and take ten full, slow, deep breaths, and then approach your next shot with a clear head. This is one of the best forms of self help for anxiety.\r\n2. Visualize\r\nPart of the reason we get stressed on the golf course is because we rush through shots, and the problem compounds. This issue can be addressed somewhat by slowing down and visualizing how you want each shot to go before you even make a practice swing. This is a proven technique used by top athletes in all sports at the highest level.\r\nBe as outlandish as you want with this technique. Many bodybuilders visualize themselves lifting weights that are far too big and heavy for any real person to lift.\r\n3. Stop Competing\r\nGolf is different from many sports because you compete against yourself more than your opponents. If you\u2019re constantly comparing every shot you make against the swings of the people you\u2019re playing with, this can mess with you\u2019re mental game. The moment you start thinking a competitor is naturally more talented or more skilled than you, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2013 you\u2019ll start to mess up.\r\nStop comparing your abilities to the people you\u2019re playing against, and focus on your own game and technique.\r\n4. Leave Work At The Office\r\nGolf is a great game for business networking, but bringing work troubles out on the fairway is a good way to make sure you play below your abilities. Work is one of the biggest causes of stress. Even if you\u2019re playing with workmates, make an effort to ban any stressful work topics from the conversation agenda. Beyond the conversation, make sure your mind isn\u2019t playing out unrelated work disaster scenarios while you\u2019re trying to putt for par. Keep your focus present in the moment and focus on the task at hand.\r\n5. Start Each Hole Fresh\r\nA bad game of golf is often like a line of dominoes falling. The first one goes, and it sets off a chain reaction. You may do great on the first five holes, then bomb on the sixth and lose confidence. From there, the rest of the game of downhill \u2013 not because your abilities have changed, but because you\u2019ve started to doubt yourself.\r\n\r\nEach hole is unrelated to the last one. Do a mental reset before you start each new hole, especially if the last hole was particularly bad. Forgive yourself for any mistakes and reframe them into positive things to focus on for the next hole. If you have a hard time letting go, look into getting some hypnosis for stress relief.\r\nEven if you follow just one of these tips for reducing stress on the golf course, you\u2019ll find that you enjoy your game of golf so much more.\r\nMore golf related articles and tips for reducing stress:","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hopehypnotherapy.com/hypnosis-tips/tips-for-reducing-stress-on-the-golf-course/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.hypnosis-self-help.com/tips-for-reducing-stress-on-the-golf-course.html"}]},{"description":"Every time I post new content on my blog, it is copied to the infringing website and linked back to my own content which gives me spammy link for my own original content which was copied.
