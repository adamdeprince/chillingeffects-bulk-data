They have a domain registrar that is used to\r\nhide their real ID, that also lists false phone numbers (410 area code\r\n(Baltimore) for a New York business)\r\n\r\nCIFIBOXSETS.COM\r\n\r\n\r\n69.93.90.72\r\nRecord Type:   IP Address\r\n\r\n\r\nOrgName:    ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.\r\nOrgID:      TPCM\r\nAddress:    1333 North Stemmons Freeway\r\nAddress:    Suite 110\r\nCity:       Dallas\r\nStateProv:  TX\r\nPostalCode: 75207\r\nCountry:    US\r\n\r\nReferralServer: rwhois://rwhois.theplanet.com:4321\r\n\r\nNetRange:   69.93.0.0 - 69.93.255.255\r\nCIDR:       69.93.0.0/16\r\nNetName:    NETBLK-THEPLANET-BLK-9\r\nNetHandle:  NET-69-93-0-0-1\r\nParent:     NET-69-0-0-0-0\r\nNetType:    Direct Allocation\r\nNameServer: NS1.THEPLANET.COM\r\nNameServer: NS2.THEPLANET.COM\r\nComment:\r\nRegDate:    2003-11-19\r\nUpdated:    2004-03-15\r\n\r\nThey claim that they do not tolerate bootlegs, but sell blatants such as\r\n\"Lost Seasons 1 and 2\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=30\r\n2\r\n\r\nSeason 2 will not finish airing until May, and the cover art is decidedly\r\ndifferent from the legit Region 3 (mainland asia) version seen here, which\r\nshares the same cover art as the US version and is also more expensive than\r\nthe domestic USA release\r\n\r\nhttp://us.yesasia.com/en/prdTransfer.aspx/pid-1004094710/\r\n\r\nThey also have multiple Star Trek box sets for sale such as this collection\r\nof Deep Space Nine\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=20\r\n1\r\n\r\nThere is no release in Asia of ANY Star Trek show on DVD except for Japan.\r\nThe Japanese sets do notlook like this, and run approximately $150 for each\r\nset, and were limited. The Complete Deep Space Nine will not be released\r\nthere until June, and will run $1200 US.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cdjapan.co.jp/detailview.html?KEY=PPSJ-1033\r\n\r\nThey also have Voyager, which is oddly labled \"Star Trek 3\", and features\r\nthe Enterprise \"E\" instead of Voyager on the cover. Something that no studio\r\nwould do, or allowed to be done by a licensee (Paramount does not license\r\nStar Trek on video to any external entity)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=20\r\n3\r\n\r\nand here's Enterprise as well, same deals\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=29\r\n6\r\n\r\nThere's no Chinese release of Stargate either\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=20\r\n4\r\n\r\nX-Files has identical box art in Region 3(and all others) to the US\r\n\r\nhttp://www.scifiboxsets.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=20\r\n6\r\n\r\nand the legit asian version\r\n\r\nhttp://us.yesasia.com/en/prdTransfer.aspx/pid-1004007165/\r\n\r\nAnd finally, \"The Simpsons Complete Seasons 1-16\"\r\n\r\nThe latest Simpsons release is Season 7 across all regions.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to take my word on these, just call the MPAA 1-800-No-COPYS\r\nor email them http://www.mpaa.org and they will confirm what I've told you.\r\nI hope you kick the bastards off of your servers, and assist the MPAA with\r\nany investigation they might launch.
