{"dmca":{"id":731,"type":"Dmca","title":"Copyright Infringement/Resale of Manuals","body":"Dear Seller:\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed your auction posted at eBay in which you have offered for sale, or have sold, copies of Sybase's proprietary\r\nsoftware. \r\n\r\nPlease be advised that the Sybase Software License Agreement prohibits the transfer of any Sybase Software license (under the\r\nAgreement, Sybase grants the licensee a nontransferable license) and thus even legitimate copies of the software may not generally\r\nbe sold or otherwise transferred.  Should you believe you have in fact been granted the authority by Sybase to sell these or that\r\nyour offering does not infringe our intellectual property, please respond with a specific description and documentation.\r\n\r\nSybase views the unauthorized transfer of its proprietary software products very seriously and is prepared to pursue legal remedies\r\nto protect its intellectual property.  However, Sybase will forego further action, provided you immediately cease all attempts to\r\nsell any Sybase software product(s).  If we discover more activity of this sort, we will immediately seek to have your account\r\nbarred from e-Bay permanently, and this matter will be referred to our Legal Department.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at [redacted] or schrist@sybase.com.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\n[redacted]\r\nAssociate Compliance Officer\r\nSybase, Inc.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[redacted]\r\n","date_sent":"2002-08-05T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-08-05T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Sybase, Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
