{"dmca":{"id":5114,"type":"Dmca","title":"DMCA (Copyright) Complaint to Google","body":"Hi Sarah & u2u-legal-escalations!\n\nWe ran into http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Webmasters/thread?tid=63bddd764429c655&hl=en\nin the forums. It's basically a thread by someone who's complaining\nthat someone is removing their posts to the newsgroup\nalt.fan.adolf-hitler.\n\nIt's off-topic to the webmasters forum, but given that there's no\nGoogle Groups forum, I guess the chit-chat sub-forum is as good as\nany... However, how much of this thread should we remove or lock or\nignore?\n\nThe initial post is clean enough:\nI post on alt.fan.adolf-hitler. Beginning yesterday, all my posts are\nbeing deleted by Google. Why?\nWhen I post on the site, I always get a verification of my post in my\ninbox.  However, my post does not appear on alt.fan.adolf-hitler.\nObviously this is being done by Google.  Why?\n\nbut some of the follow-ups are a bad:\nThat just doesn't make sense.  Jews go onto that particular forum and\npost porn all the time. Google doesn't seem to care about that.\nUnless of course, Google is owned by Jews.  Could that be the case?\n\nAlso, the user's profile uses a swastika:\nhttps://profiles.google.com/114977325947981171101/posts?hl=en\n\nThoughts? I assume just removing the problematic posts is enough,\nright? or do we need to do more here?\n\nThanks!\nJohn\n\n-- \nJohn Mueller - go/wta\nGoogle Switzerland GmbH\nWant to post in the forums? go/help-webmasters\n","date_sent":"2011-06-28T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2011-06-28T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
