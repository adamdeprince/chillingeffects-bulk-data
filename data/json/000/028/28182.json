Informing subscribers and account\r\nholders of acts of infringement is a crucial element to a policy\r\nproviding for the termination of repeat infringers.\r\n|\r\n| This letter does not constitute an exhaustive statement of TITAN\r\nMedia's legal position, nor is it a waiver of any of our rights and/or\r\nremedies in this or any other matter, all of which are expressly\r\nreserved.
