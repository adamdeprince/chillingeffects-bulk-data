They have posted HUNDREDS\r\nof articles (the full text, not just the links) from articles that\r\nbelong to publications like the New York Times and The Washington\r\nPost. They have one of my articles posted, and I did not give them\r\npermission to do so. I asked them to remove it, and they refused to\r\ncomply. Below is my e-mail exchange with the company's\r\nrepresentative, Paul Cone.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know as soon as possible how you are going to address\r\nthis problem.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nDawn Weinberger\r\nFreelance Writer\r\n503-681-8548\r\ndawn.weinberger@comcast.net\r\nwww.dawnweinberger.com\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn,\r\n\r\nThe link at the top of the article links directly to the Portland\r\nTribune and thus your article.  We usually put a tagline on the end\r\nof our posts that say we reprint an article for educational purposes,\r\nbut I forgot to do that.  Here is that text, which I have added to\r\nthe post:\r\n\r\n(In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C. Section 107, this material is\r\ndistributed without profit to those who have expressed a prior\r\ninterest in receiving the included information for research and\r\neducational purposes.)\r\n\r\nWe offer our News Forum as a way to share information about ideas we\r\nlike with our website guests.  There is no profit being made off your\r\nwork.  And there is no intent to represent anyone else's work as\r\nanything but theirs -- that is why we always print the byline and the\r\nsource.  In 5 years we have not had one complaint from anyone else\r\nand I would think that you would be happy to have your work published\r\nfurther than just Portland.   I get my copy of the Tribune from the\r\nbox outside city hall and I thought it was such a great article that\r\nI posted it the same day.  We get a lot of hits and so a lot of\r\npeople from all over the world saw it.  Having been a journalist at\r\none point myself as well as a freelancer, I would think that you\r\nwould as many people as possible to see your talent.   We get\r\ncoverage regularly in magazines such as Natural Home and always get\r\ngreat comments on our website so that it more exposure we are giving\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nPaul Cone\r\nEve's Garden Ecology Resource Center\r\n\r\nOn Mar 27, 2007, at 4:27 PM, Eve's Garden wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> ---------- Forwarded message ----------\r\n> From: Dawn Weinberger <dawn.weinberger@comcast.net>\r\n> Date: Mar 27, 2007 6:19 PM\r\n> Subject: please remove article\r\n> To: info@evesgarden.org\r\n>\r\n> Hello -- I noticed you have one of my articles, The Dirt on Green\r\n> Cleaning, posted on your home page.
