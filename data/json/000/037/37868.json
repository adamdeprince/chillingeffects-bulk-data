Ms. Thomas did not give permission for her material to\r\nappear on this Website.  Moreover, the person who is using Ms. Thomas's\r\nmaterial is not presenting it for informational purposes.  He or she is\r\nusing it to serve as filler text, into which is placed the phrase \"fm\r\ntransmitter ipod shuffle\".  The apparent intent is to manipulate search\r\nengine bots into giving this Web page a higher ranking than it would\r\notherwise have.\r\n\r\nThis is plagiarism.  It does not fall within the purview of \"fair use\".  It\r\nis simply misuse of Ms. Thomas's work.  Please remove the text immediately.\r\nThere are plenty of texts in the public domain that could serve the same\r\npurpose, without infringing on the rights of living authors.  Using this\r\ntext is unnecessary and illegal.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n- -Baruch Ben-David\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.1 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Thunderbird - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFDk3jlvK/XpJs6oyURAolAAJ0ckQK3aTTgsIZz6IFKji/Flx30JwCfbLNz\r\nxMB0QTl153srToCSVsX4V3w=\r\n=8XJu\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-12-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Baruch Ben-David","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
