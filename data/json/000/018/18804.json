This is to notify you that I have found at least one full text article of mine on that web service and that it is copyright material registered to me personally.\r\n\r\nMoreover you are using this article next to Google click through advertisements.  This is a clear violation of my copyright for commercial advantage.  I have never licensed this or any other article to Mail Archive or to the person who originally copied it without permission.\r\n\r\nThe copyright is registered at the U.S. Copyright Office.  Please remove this and any other articles of my authorship from the Mail Archive.  Do it at once and don't do it again.\r\n\r\nThis will be my only letter on this topic.  Further communications, if necessary, will come from my attorney.  The last firm that ignored my letters on copyright infringement was sued and settled out of court for a substantial sum.\r\n\r\nDo not try my patience.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nFrancis Hamit","date_sent":"2007-01-05T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-05T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Francis Hamit","recipient_name":"The Mail Archive","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
