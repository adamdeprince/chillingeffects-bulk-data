{"dmca":{"id":31490,"type":"Dmca","title":"[Fwd: [ABUSE] Copyright/Trademark Infringement]","body":" Dear Mr. Hall:\r\n\r\nWe are in receipt of you Trademark Complaint dated January 15, 2006. The\r\ndisputed material in the above-referenced letter is the domain name, not the\r\ncontent of the website. As an ISP, we are compelled by Federal Law to\r\ndisable access of website if it infringes copyright or trademark rights of\r\nthird parties. This is not the case since the website www.mygen.us neither\r\nuses the Trademark MyGen on his website nor has MyGen content display there.\r\nAs the disputed material is the domain name and it is not under our control,\r\nbecause it was not registered with us. This issue should be resolved either\r\nby the registrar of the domain name mygen.us, which is GO DADDY SOFTWARE,\r\nINC., or ICANN.\r\n\r\nLegal Response Team\r\nThePlanet.com\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: The Planet Policy Enforcement [mailto:abuse@theplanet.com] \r\nSent: Sunday, January 15, 2006 2:53 PM\r\nTo: copyright@theplanet.com; rob@cubed3d.co.uk\r\nSubject: [Fwd: [ABUSE] Copyright/Trademark Infringement]\r\n\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA1\r\n\r\nYour email is being forwarded on to our Copyright counsel for review, at the\r\naddress of copyright@theplanet.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n- -------- Original Message --------\r\nSubject:         [ABUSE] Copyright/Trademark Infringement\r\nDate:         Sat, 14 Jan 2006 02:22:28 -0000\r\nFrom:         Rob Hall <rob@cubed3d.co.uk>\r\nTo:         <abuse@theplanet.com>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Whom It May Concern\r\n\r\nI write to you to inform you of a copyright/trademark infringement on a\r\nwebsite hosted on your servers.\r\nwww.mygen.us <http://www.mygen.us> - This website is unlawfully using my\r\nregistered trademark MyGen, (www.mygen.co.uk <http://www.mygen.co.uk>) and\r\npassing it as their own, making money from my good name.\r\nI have contacted the webmaster in question, but they don't seem to be taking\r\nthis matter at all seriously, hence my reason for contacting yourselves.\r\nCould you please investigate this as a matter of urgency, as I'd really like\r\nto avoid the legal path, but my company is losing revenue as a result of\r\nthis infringement.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\nRobert Hall\r\nMyGen(TM)\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFDyrYkvK/XpJs6oyURAozWAJ9OiYUZY5F0REqwQHU4AhhfialSgQCfSCYI\r\nGQyxAlxi6vRUSZuXrDMBZCQ=\r\n=CN/p\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-01-16T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-01-16T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"MyGen(TM)","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
