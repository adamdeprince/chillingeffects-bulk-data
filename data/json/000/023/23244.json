We believe that they are using 4 Un-metered servers\r\nthrough ServerMatrix to host and distribute their warez music videos.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that they do not have the legal right to distribute\r\nthese 10,500+ music videos because...\r\n\r\n1.)  They are distributing them for free on their website\r\n2.)  They are removing the copyright marks in the music video which is\r\nrequired by law to be present\r\n3.)  They do not reference any credits to the original artist to the music\r\nvideo.\r\n4.)  They are not giving royalties to the record industries for distributing\r\nthe music videos for free.\r\n\r\n5.) According the the RIAA Anti-Piracy team\r\n(1-800-Bad-Beat) the website does NOT have the legal right or authority to\r\ndistribute or host these music videos on your servers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfringing Warez Music Videos Can Be Located Here...\r\n\r\n\r\nx1.musicvideocodes.com\r\n70.85.110.211  - Registered To ThePlanet\r\n\r\nx2.musicvideocodes.com\r\n70.85.110.195  - Registered To ThePlanet\r\n\r\nx3.musicvideocodes.com\r\n70.85.110.203  - Registered To ThePlanet\r\n\r\nx4.musicvideocodes.com\r\n70.85.114.91   - Registered To ThePlanet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInfringing Warez Music Videos Are Being Distributed Here...\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.musicvideocodes.com\r\n67.18.200.97  - Registered To ThePlanet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples of how to find the infringing material can be found by...\r\n\r\n1.) Visit \"any\" page between\r\nhttp://www.musicvideocodes.com/?song=38 and\r\nhttp://www.musicvideocodes.com/?song=2600 and the video that will start to\r\nplay on that page is coming from the pirated music videos on your servers\r\nlisted above.\r\n2.) When viewing any page displaying a video you can see the exact location\r\nof the URL by viewing the page source and looking for something that will\r\nlook like this...\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.musicvideocodes.com/?song=2600...\r\n\r\n<embed style=\"FILTER: xray\" name=\"RAOCXplayer\"\r\nsrc=\"http://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//7803445363.asf\"\r\ntype=\"application/x-mplayer2\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\"\r\n\r\nWhere on this page the pirated music video is being\r\nhosted at \r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//   which is located\r\non ThePlanet's network.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is just a small list of exact URL's to the\r\npirated music...\r\n\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6110354462.wmv\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6110434721.wmv\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6111302953.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6111005450.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6021324161.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6111094392.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6111152420.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6111225865.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6112061591.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6112173641.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6112250123.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6112270742.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6111335888.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6111491016.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6111421666.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113083675.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6112453421.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6111560139.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6112335468.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6112083017.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6112404697.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113081586.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113160370.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6112311787.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113274922.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//611320239.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6113550582.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113303226.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113413785.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6113582063.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6222242281.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6222412583.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6115163597.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6114214781.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6222095198.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6222173086.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6114124188.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6221593313.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6114430563.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6114010771.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6114202178.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6115473066.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6114104050.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6114003041.asf\r\nhttp://x4.musicvideocodes.com/29//6221515149.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6114344775.asf\r\nhttp://x3.musicvideocodes.com/21//6113422198.asf\r\nhttp://x2.musicvideocodes.com/38//6221421541.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6113493057.asf\r\nhttp://x1.musicvideocodes.com/96//6115294135.asf\r\n\r\nThe above is just a list of 50 videos, please note\r\nthat EACH server is hosting over\r\n2,500+ pirated music videos.  Also please note that in\r\nan effort to disguise the\r\nlocation of the music videos they often change the\r\nfolder location of the music video,\r\nbut it is always on the same server, just a different\r\nfolder.  If you look for folder\r\nwith 7+ Gigs of data, I'm sure you will have no\r\nproblem finding it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that it would be in your best interest to\r\nimmediately disable access to the\r\ninfringing material and notify the owner of the\r\ncontent that it has been reported to\r\nthe RIAA Anti-Piracy team and that there are currently\r\ninvestigating this.  I am sure\r\nthey will send you a DMCA notice shortly, but it may\r\nbe to your benefit if you stop\r\nthis illegal activity before you are hit with the DMCA\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain we want to emphasize that according the RIAA\r\nAnti-Piracy team which can be \r\nreached at 1-800-Bad-Beat this website does \"not\" have\r\nthe legal authority to host or\r\ndistribute these music videos in any way.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nMike Anderson\r\n\r\nCommunity Alliance For Anti-Piracy","date_sent":"2005-05-11T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-11T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Community Alliance For Anti-Piracy","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
