{"dmca":{"id":4731,"type":"Dmca","title":"Subpoena Report","body":"I had verizon dsl.  I received the copy of the subpoena late.  I didn't figure I had anything to worry about with it because I have never downloaded music.  I have never done nor has anyone in my household done what this subpoena is stating.  A couple months after receiving this, I received a letter from a lawfirm stating that these record companies are going to sue me.\r\n\r\nI feel that either Verizon has given wrong information to these people or somehow my computer was broken into.  This is causing me a lot of grief.  I am a disabled single mom with a young child and am not sure how I am going to afford to defend myself on this.\r\n\r\nWhen I had Verizon DSL, I had a lot of problems with them.  I do know they changed my ISP address at least three times.  I know this because on at least one occasion when I had problems with my service, they changed it.  I don't know if that would have anything to do with this or not.\r\n","date_sent":"2004-11-22T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-11-22T05:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Jenner & Block LLP","principal_name":"Verizon","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
