Please do not share\r\nthis information with searchsilver.com as it would facilitate future\r\npiracy.\r\n\r\nThe scripts will probably be located in the cgi-bin directory but could\r\nalso be located in root public_html or a sub directory of cgi-bin. The\r\nfirst script to look for would be sf.cgi. Some of the pirated scripts\r\nwill also probably be located in an additional sub directory called\r\n/include.\r\n\r\nHere are the names of the additional copied scripts you might find:\r\nsf.cgi, clickstats.cgi, searchstats.cgi, proxyguard.cgi, earnings.cgi,\r\nmemclicks.cgi, cntryadmin.cgi, confirm.cgi, countrystats.cgi,\r\nxmltweak.cgi, pglive.cgi, inactive.cgi, backup.cgi, feedme.cgi,\r\nmenume.cgi, miscme.cgi.\r\n\r\nIt is also likely that the base search engine scripts powering this site\r\nis an illegal copy of scripts owned by SmarterScripts.com. These scripts\r\nwill contain code modifications copyrighted by me. This is in addition\r\nto the complete scripts mentioned above. Base scripts that probably\r\ncontain pirated code modifications:\r\nsmartsearch.cgi, include.cgi, accounts.cgi, crawl.cgi, admin_misc.cgi,\r\nfunctions.cgi, search.cgi and a variety of others.\r\n\r\nI affirm that I am the sole owner of the copyrighted material in\r\nquestion and that all information contained herein is true and correct.\r\nI have attached a digital scan of my signature.\r\n\r\nI am requesting immediate removal.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nIan Kelley\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\nIan Kelley - Web Design and Programming\r\nEnding world hunger through clever UI implementation.\r\n\r\nTen years experience with HTML, web graphics, SEO and user interface\r\n(UI) design.
