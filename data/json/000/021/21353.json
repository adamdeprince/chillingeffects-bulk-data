The particulars of our complaint are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The copyrighted works at issue are:\r\n\r\nthree photographs of potential Cosmopolitan magazine covers featuring Ashlee Simpson that were initially published by Cosmopolitan at http://ivillage.opinionware.com/owuser/cosmopolitan/model3/022207_simpson24.htm;\r\n\r\n\r\ntwo photographs of potential Cosmopolitan magazine covers featuring Jessica Biel that were initially published by Cosmopolitan at http://ivillage.opinionware.com/owuser/cosmopolitan/cover2/040507_jessicabiel_24.htm\r\n\r\nAn entire feature from Esquire magazine featuring Halle Berry. The material from Esquire magazine is being published in this month's issue of Esquire (May). It has not yet even been published on Esquire's own website.\r\n\r\nThe Ashlee Simpson and Jessica Biel photos were removed from Cosmopolitan's website after we learned of the infringement.\r\n\r\n2. The infringing works all appear on celebritysource.blogspot.com as follows:\r\n\r\nAshlee Simpson photos at: celebritysource.blogspot.com/2007/04/ashlee-simpson-cosmopolitan-magazine.html.\r\n\r\nJessica Biel photos at: celebritysource.blogspot.com/2007/04/jessica-biel-cosmopolitan-july-07.html\r\n\r\nHalle Berry photos at: celebritysource.blogspot.com/2007/04/halle-berry-esquire-magazine.html\r\n\r\n3. I can be reached at dweaver@hearst.com or c/o Hearst Communications, Inc., 300 West 57th Street, New York, NY 10019.\r\n\r\n4. I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\n5. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am authorized to represent Hearst Communications, Inc., the exclusive licensee of these copyrighted images.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nDebra S.
