This news story was picked up by a few other  \nnews websites which cite CNN-IBN source. CNN-BN have since retracted their  \nstory and apologized to me in writing. Some of the other websites that  \npublished the false story have also retracted the story and apologized.\n\nHowever there a few sites that have not removed their story from their  \nwebsites. Communication with these companies has failed because they do not  \npublish a contact address.\n\nGoogle has indexed these stories with keywords \u201cB K Ratnakar Rao\u201d and a  \nGoogle search for my name on the internet shows links to these false  \nstories.
