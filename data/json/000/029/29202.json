I have attempted to remove this infraction by\r\ndelivering two notifications of Cease and Desist to the e-mail of record\r\nhowever the domain owner refuses to remove it.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.get-insurance-quote.info/quote/progressive-car-insurance.html\r\nSite uses Progressive in the URL and diverts traffic to Net Quote\r\n\r\nThe domain owner of this site is deliberately trying to cause customer\r\nconfusion by using Progressive terms to divert web traffic away from\r\nProgressive's website www.progressive.com. This action constitutes trademark\r\ninfringement and unfair competition. I am therefore asking for your\r\nassistance in having the domain owner remove all references to Progressive\r\nInsurance from their site.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLegal Administrator <administrator-100@legal-notification.com>\r\n[IFID:28MY9]\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFEKDsnvK/XpJs6oyURAui6AJwK1Vhn6T7YFr3FqJda+cyY6Jz/jACglOh/\r\nI9r1Du2Z0jusvCmpjnpzoq8=\r\n=4NEX\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-03-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-03-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Progressive Insurance","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
