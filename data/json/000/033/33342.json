(RIAA) and its member record companies.  The RIAA is a\r\ntrade association whose member companies create, manufacture and\r\ndistribute approximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound\r\nrecordings sold in the United States.  Under penalty of perjury, we\r\nsubmit that the RIAA is authorized to act on behalf of its member\r\ncompanies in matters involving the infringement of their sound\r\nrecordings, including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights\r\non the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe believe your service is hosting the above-referenced IRC server on\r\nits system.  This server, which we accessed on 1/23/07 at 11:42 a.m.\r\n(EST), offers approximately 209 sound files for download.  Many of these\r\nfiles contain recordings owned by our member companies, including songs\r\nby the artists known as Keren Ann and Bloc Party, which have not yet\r\nbeen commercially released.  We have a good faith belief that the\r\nabove-described activity is not authorized by the copyright owner, its\r\nagent, or the law.  We assert that the information in this notification\r\nis accurate, based upon the data available to us.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for your immediate assistance in stopping this\r\nunauthorized activity.  Specifically, we request that you remove the\r\nserver, delete the infringing sound files or that you disable access to\r\nthis server or the infringing files being offered via your system.  In\r\naddition, please inform the site operator of the illegality of his or\r\nher conduct and confirm with the RIAA, in writing, that this activity\r\nhas ceased. \r\n\r\nYou should understand that this letter constitutes notice to you that\r\nthis site operator may be liable for the infringing activity occurring\r\non your service.  In addition, under the Digital Millennium Copyright\r\nAct, if you ignore this notice, you and/or your company may also be\r\nliable for any resulting infringement.  This letter does not constitute\r\na waiver of any right to recover damages incurred by virtue of any such\r\nunauthorized activities, and such rights as well as claims for other\r\nrelief are expressly retained. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your prompt assistance in this matter.  If you\r\nhave any questions, please feel free to contact me via e-mail at \r\nantipiracy@riaa.com <mailto:antipiracy@riaa.com> , via telephone at\r\n(202) 775-0101, or via mail at RIAA, 1025 F Street N.W., 10th Floor,\r\nWashington, D.C., 20004.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nTraci Crippen\r\n\r\nOnline Copyright Protection\r\n\r\nRIAA\r\n\r\n<<smime.p7b>> \r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2007-01-23T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-23T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"RIAA","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
