The\r\n'Copyright' she speaks of is text that was used in a creative endeavor that\r\ninvolved well over one hundred people, of which her contribution is merely a\r\nsmall part. The exact text she is protecting  can be found at\r\nhttp://www.westeros.org/Misc/AlterEgo/Angharad.html\r\n\r\nInternational copyright law does not recognize the \"rights\" that she often\r\nattempts to invoke with what is technically an addition to teh public\r\ndomain, despite her claims of holding copyright. In addition, even IF this\r\nwere copyrighted material, she threatens legal action when a website merely\r\nlinks to her page, which is open for public viewing.\r\n\r\nQuite honestly, this woman has a long history of threatening anyone in the\r\non-line community who disagrees with her 'talent' and she is a running joke,\r\nbut a very vocal running joke who threatens lawsuits every chance she gets\r\nin hopes of making ISPs back down.\r\n\r\nI send this letter in hopes of getting a very sincere point across. Linda\r\nAntonsson is threatening legal action that she cannot take. She is not to be\r\ntaken seriously and giving in to her demands only makes her percieved legal\r\nclaim stronger, while it really has no grounds at all.\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCE3LJvK/XpJs6oyURAhQlAJ0TAlKZDy9wAZdkNVMlNx6CTDXZywCffJwL\r\nnBfMshcucycsMsPRDAXNk44=\r\n=lZtn\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2005-02-16T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-02-16T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
