(\"Apple\").  It has come to our attention that your website is posting screenshots of a pre-release developer's build of Apple's new operating system, Mac OS X 10.5 (aka \"Leopard\") Build 9A303, at http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2254.  You should already be aware that this build has been distributed to developers under strict terms of confidentiality that prohibit any dissemination of the code or screenshots of the software.  The software is also copyrighted by Apple, and copyright law explicitly prohibits unauthorized displays of copyrighted works. \r\n\r\nApple therefore demands that you remove all Leopard screenshots from your website and take steps to prevent any further distribution of screenshots of Apple software without Apple's authorization.  If you are represented by counsel, please provide me with the identity of that counsel. \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your cooperation,\r\n\r\n/s/ [private]\r\n\r\n[private]\r\nO","date_sent":"2006-11-27T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-11-27T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trade Secret","Copyright"],"sender_name":"O","principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"AppleInsider","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
