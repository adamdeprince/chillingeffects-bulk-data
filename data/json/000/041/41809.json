There\u2019s no need to buy new seats if you move house or redecorate, as a new slipcover can give your furniture the makeover it needs in just a matter of minutes.  Many people like to have a spare set of slipcovers, so they can easily change the style of their whole room to suit the occasion or according to the seasons.\r\n\r\nSemi fitted stretch slipcovers have a unique one-piece design that features hidden elastic to hold the cover in place, for a smooth and snug-fitting finish.  The quality easy-care fabrics are all tested for durability, color-fastness and shrinkage, and can all be machine-washed when necessary.  Popular choices include twill, cotton, stretch denim, chenille and damask.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also a great selection of colors and patterns to choose from, to match to any style of d\u00e9cor.  We hope you find something on this website to inspire you to experiment with slipcovers as part of your home d\u00e9cor or simply to help you give your furniture a makeover on a budget.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://how-to-do-it.net/how-to/tag/how-to-clean-fabric-furniture/"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.getslipcovers.com/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
