Disable access to the individual or company who has engaged in the\r\n| conduct described above, and;\r\n|\r\n| 2. Take appropriate action against the account holder under your Abuse\r\n| Policy/Terms of Service Agreement.\r\n|\r\n| Completeness requires that I should point out the following to you:\r\n|\r\n| 1. The distribution of unauthorized copies of copyrighted motion\r\n| pictures constitutes copyright infringement under the Copyright Act,\r\n| Title 17 United States Code Section 106(3). This conduct may also\r\n| violate the laws of other countries, international law, and/or treaty\r\n| obligations.\r\n|\r\n| 2. Pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17 United\r\n| States Code Section 512, that we have a good faith belief that use of\r\n| the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the\r\n| copyright owners, their respective agents, or the law.\r\n|\r\n| 3. Copyright law is a strict liability tort and does not require the\r\n| entity committing the infringement, or responsible for the infringement,\r\n| to be aware that their actions are in violation of law. The absence of\r\n| knowledge, or even intent, does not negate the infringement and is not a\r\n| defense.  Contributory copyright infringement requires that the entity\r\n| know, or should have known, that they were inducing, causing or\r\n| materially contributing to the commission of a direct infringement.\r\n| Material or activity which promotes the commission of an  infringement,\r\n| therefore, may constitute contributory infringement.\r\n|\r\n| PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS AT LEAST THE SECOND TIME I HAVE A DMCA NOTICE\r\n| REGARDING THIS SITE - THE PRIOR TIME WAS TO EVERYONES INTERNET, AND THEY\r\n| OBVIOUSLY SIMPLY MOVED NEXT DOOR TO YOU.\r\n|\r\n| *****************************\r\n|\r\n| Dean Sheldon Serwin\r\n| The Taft Building\r\n| 1680 N.
