The last time I searched, six months ago, the website was registered in Turkey, and the domain was registered under the same name as their IP. The articles are posted as if by visitors to the site, but in fact are posted by the site owners themselves who hide behind a disclaimer at the bottom of the page. Probably all their website content is stolen from others just as our article was. The only address I could find on the whole site is: [private]\r\n\r\nStatutory Declaration:\r\n\r\nI [private] have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.\r\n\r\nI declare*, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: I am a Christian missionary, God's Word specifically commands me NOT to swear, just let your yes be yes.
