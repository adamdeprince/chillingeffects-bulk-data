My request is to remove\r\nthe infringement material and/or even suspend current and future and/or\r\nassociated account(s).\r\n\r\nAs per your requirements:\r\n\r\n# A physical or electronic signature of a person (\"Complaining Party\")\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is\r\nclaimed to be infringed.\r\n\r\nHereby I inform you that I am the author of various styles and therefor the\r\nauthorized party to request the my material to be removed as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n# Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or\r\nif multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a\r\nsingle notification, a representative list of such works at that site.\r\n\r\nI've created the commercial style package vBulletin.nl Professional Style\r\nPackage 1.x for vBulletin version 3.0.x and have sold it to licensed\r\nvBulletin customers. They have been notified prior to purchase that they are\r\nnot allowed to resell, lease, sublet or distribute the resource at any time.\r\nThe resource (until recently) was being sold through the unofficial\r\nvBulletin fan web site www.vBulletin.nl\r\n\r\n# Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be\r\nthe subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to\r\nwhich is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the\r\nservice provider to locate the material\r\n\r\nMy resources: \r\nhttp://2u43.cjb.net/vB/303-306/vBulletin-Fans.com_Style2.zip\r\nhttp://2u43.cjb.net/vB/303-306/vBulletin-Fans.com_Style1.zip\r\nand more importantly: \r\nhttp://2u43.cjb.net/vB/303-306/Pro%20Style%5bvb.nl%5d.zip\r\n\r\nNote: the host 2u43.cjb.net is a host alias that resolves to the IP address:\r\n67.19.214.195\r\nNote: the IP address 67.19.214.195 reverse resolves to the Host address:\r\n195.67-19-214.reverse.theplanet.com\r\n\r\n# Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to\r\ncontact the Complaining Party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if\r\navailable, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be\r\ncontacted\r\n\r\nMy name is Floris Fiedeldij Dop, author of the above vBulletin styles and\r\nyou can contact me on  info@vBulletin.nl\r\n\r\n# A statement that the Complaining Party has a good faith belief that use of\r\nthe material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright\r\nowner, its agent, or the law; and \r\n\r\nYes, I have never given permission to distribute my copyrighted material\r\nover the internet.
