The image in question was originally a part of my personal webspace that I neglected to place a robots.txt file on. I would like to have it removed from googles [sic] image cache as I no longer have access to that webspace (it was an old dialup internet account that apparantly hasn't been deleted, but I have no access) - I will be contacting the ISP today to see if it can be removed.\r\n\r\nhttp://home.iprimus.com.au/needlecracker/pic/mesmalldark.jpg \r\nhttp://home.iprimus.com.au/needlecracker/pic/wristwatch.jpg\r\n\r\nThe ISP that owns this webspace is: www.iprimus.com.au\r\n\r\nYou may contact me back at this email address: ([private]) for further information if you wish.\r\n\r\nI swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate and that, for each image identified above, I either own the copyright or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed,\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2004-02-03T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-02-03T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Google, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
