Because you should now have\r\nboth full and constructive knowledge about said activities, your\r\ncontinued support and fostering of such infringing activities eliminates\r\nany safe harbor defenses under the DMCA and you can and will be hell\r\nfully liable as a contributory infringer for any future infringements\r\nrelated to your hosting of websites featuring celebrity photos.","date_sent":"2006-04-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-04-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"Theplanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
