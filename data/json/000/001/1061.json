{"dmca":{"id":1061,"type":"Dmca","title":"divine e-commerce patents (2)","body":"Dear Sirs,\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it does not appear that you believe divine is serious with respect to enforcing its patent rights. You have now ignored letters from divine as well as our recent correspondence regarding [your] infringement of certain of divine's patents.\r\n\r\nIn order to ensure that unnecessary legal expenses are not generated, we would like to resolve this matter on an amicable basis without resort to the courts. Therefore, I am enclosing, under cover of this letter, a draft License Agreement. I believe you will find the terms of the license to be quite reasonable. If so, please contact me so we can finalize the License Agreement. Of course, if you would like to discuss any of the terms of the License Agreement, please contact me.\r\n\r\nHowever, please rest assured that we will not allow [your] infringement of divine's patents to continue unabated. To ensure there are no miscalculations and to demonstrate divine's resolve with respect to this issue, I am also enclosing, a Complaint that we recently filed against FTD.com for patent infringement. For your information, this matter was resolved after the Complaint was filed.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you in the near future regarding our licensing proposal. However, if I do not hear from you by November 22, 2002, the licensing offer will be revoked and divine will proceed accordingly.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\n[Private]","date_sent":"2002-11-15T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2002-11-15T05:00:00Z","topics":["E-Commerce Patents","Copyright"],"sender_name":"Bell, Boyd & Lloyd","principal_name":"Divine, Inc.","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
