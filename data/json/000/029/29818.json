The Nutrimetics trade mark is also the subject\r\nof trade mark registrations in relation to among other things,\r\ncosmetics, soaps, toiletries and associated services involving the\r\nmarketing and distribution of these products in various jurisdictions. \r\n  \r\nNutrimetics have also acquired extensive common law rights in relation\r\nto these trade marks as a result of many years' use.  Only Nutrimetics\r\nand its authorised distributors and licensees may use the Nutrimetics\r\ntrade marks and in fact distribute products bearing the Nutrimetics \r\ntrademark.   \r\n \r\nI am instructed that these web sites are or have been displaying,\r\noffering for sale and/or selling products bearing the Nutrimetics trade\r\nmarks on websites depicting the Nutrimetics trademark and displaying\r\ncopyright protected images from Nutrimetics brochures and catalogues\r\nwithout the licence or authority of the intellectual property owner. \r\nThis conduct constitutes an infringement of Nutrimetics' intellectual\r\nproperty rights.  It causes us considerable concern and entitles\r\nNutrimetics to commence proceedings against the web site owners for\r\ninjunctions (including interlocutory injunctions) orders for delivery up\r\n\r\nand compensation.     \r\n \r\nNutrimetics therefore has sent a demand to the web site administrator to\r\n: \r\n \r\n1. immediately and voluntarily remove the unauthorized copyright\r\nprotected images from these websites; and 2. immediately and voluntarily\r\nremove the unauthorized domain names from the internet. \r\nWe would be most grateful if you could also advise us as to what further\r\ninformation you require from us in order to implement the removal of\r\nthis site from the internet in light of the infringement of our rights\r\nin this regard. \r\n \r\nI may be reached on +61 438 174 373 or by reply email and would\r\nappreciate your urgent response and assistance. \r\n \r\nKind regards \r\n \r\nGeorgia Potiris\r\nLegal Counsel & Company Secretary\r\nNutrimetics Australia Pty Ltd\r\n5 Burwood Highway\r\nWantirna Vic  3152\r\nPh: + 61 3 9298 7019\r\nFax: + 61 3 9801 1072\r\nMobile: 0438 174 373  ","date_sent":"2006-06-20T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-06-20T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Nutrimetics Australia Pty Ltd","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
