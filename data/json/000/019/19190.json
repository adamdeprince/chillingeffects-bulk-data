Apparently, it contains enough accurate information to make it seem plausible.\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that this facebook account is NOT Dr. Farris.  Even though the information might look genuine, he is in no way connected with it.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, whoever the individual is who set this account up, also set up a gmail account and has been sending PHC students and others threatening emails regarding computer use violations and ordering them to report to his office.  Again, such emails are fraudulent.\r\n\r\nWe have both have spoken with Dr. Farris about this, and we are all in agreement that whoever is doing this is engaging in criminal activity and could very possibly face criminal prosecution for their actions.\r\n \r\nWe would encourage the \"creator\" of this false information--if it is by any chance a PHC student--to come forward immediately.  Clemency is possible, but this is no longer a joke.\r\n \r\nThanks for your attention.\r\n\r\nGraham Walker\r\nPresident,\r\nPatrick Henry College\r\n \r\nMatt Roche\r\nPresident,\r\nPatrick Henry College Student Body","date_sent":"2007-02-02T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-02-02T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Patrick Henry College","recipient_name":"Patrick Henry College","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
