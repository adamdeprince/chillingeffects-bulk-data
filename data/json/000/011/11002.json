I have uploaded a cropped sample at the\n \nabove URL, however, there is no other \"authorized version\" available on\nthe  \ninternet, because I do not wish for this material to be found online. The\noffending website is displaying it fraudulently, in full knowledge that it\n \nis against my wishes, and with the sole intent to defame my name.\n\nAs I write this, the image shows up on the 9th page of the Google Search  \n\nresults when my name, \"nicolas pelletier\" is typed in the search box. As  \n\nyou can see, the sample is of a high resolution; there would be no other  \n\nway for me to possess this than by being the author, since I have never  \nuploaded such a high-resolution version on the internet.\nIf the above does not suffice as proof of my ownership, I can also produce\n \nthe original Photoshop files of the entire book. Please let me know if\nthis  \nis necessary, and which e-mail address I should send them to.\n\nPlease note:\nI have already reported this exact case last year, and your website ruled \n \nin my favor, and the image was removed. However, the offending website has\n \nsince changed its URL from a .ch domain to a .se domain. As a result, the \n\nimage is back in the search results once again.\nYou can see last year's case here:","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://images.encyclopediadramatica.se/thumb/1/10/Nicochipedophile.jpg/100px-Nicochipedophile.jpg"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://oi39.tinypic.com/34p19mp.jpg"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
