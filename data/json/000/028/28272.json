This new standard\r\ncancels and replaces the old ISO 9000-3:1997 software standard. The old ISO 9000-3\r\nstandard explained how ISO9001:1994 could be applied to computer software. Similarly,\r\nthe new ISO 90003 standard explains how ISO 9001:2000 can be applied to computer\r\nsoftware. Since ISO 9000-3 was designed to be used with the old ISO 9001:1994\r\nstandard, it had to be updated to make it compatible with the new ISO 9001:2000\r\nstandard.\u201d\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING TEXT WAS COPIED FROM http://www.praxiom.com/iso-13485-intro.htm (see ISO 13485 VERSUS ISO 9001 paragraph 2) TO http://www.mfk.unideb.hu/userdir/dmk/docs/20072/07_2_03.pdf (see your page 38, 39):\r\n\r\n\u201c...
