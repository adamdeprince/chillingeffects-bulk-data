On August 22, 2007, I sent you a DMCA Notice requesting the removal of hundreds of links of content stolen from Xcentric's website www.RipoffReport.com\r\n\tRather than complying with the DMCA Notice, Google responded on September 6, 2007 stating:\r\n\"Per our company policy, we require that you list each infringing URL along with each specific corresponding copyrighted URL.  At this time, we ask that you resend us your complaint with additional information.\" \r\n\tPlease note that regardless of Google company policy, if Google wishes to maintain the safe harbor provided by 17 U.S.C. 512(d) it is required to respond in a timely manner to notices that \"substantially comply\" with the DMCA.  My prior notice substantially complied with each and every part of the DMCA including 17 include a list of \"each specific corresponding copyrighted URL.\"\r\n\tNevertheless, even though Xcentric is clearly not required by the DMCA to do so, in order to assist Google in complying with the law, I am resubmitting the previous DMCA Notice supported by a table (attached) which lists every copyrighted URL alongside the list of infringing URLs.\r\n[page 2]\r\nIn that regard, the following information is provided pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3)(A):\r\n1. The copyrighted works being infringed include reports posted on www.RipoffReport.com of which Xcentric is the copyright owner.\r\nSee attached spreadsheet incorporated herein by reference.\r\n2. The infringing material is located at the following URL's:\r\nSee attached spreadsheet incorporated herein by reference.\r\nThe infringing material listed above is also contained within cached Google sites based on the following queries: Search query: \"ripoff123456\" where \"123456\" is the actual # indicated in the URL listed above.\r\n\r\nFor example, a query for \"ripoff4771\" returns virtually all variants of the above URLs which end with the same suffix; e.g.: \"/ripoff4771.html\". Listing every cached version of each of the above URLs would be unduly time consuming.  However, some examples of infringing sites in Google's cache are:\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache: foWaqXKjxoJ:www.remove-rip-off-reports.com/ripoff232627.html+ripoff4771&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:H9Xe0oz8BzgJ:www.repsavior.com/ripoff238870.html+ripoff4771&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:UIHe-L1NUxcJ:www.complaintremover.com/ripoff174997.html+complaintremover+ripoff&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:AzxVyroZz-MJ:www.repsavior.com/ripoff243504.html+ripoff239329&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:zKDlsV73XuMJ:www.complaintremover.com/ripoff107525.html+ripoff239329&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us\r\n\r\nhttp://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:s5tT7nK92Z4J:www.reputationshield.com/ripoffl93448.html+ripoff4771&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=9&gl=us\r\n\r\n[page 3]\r\n3.
