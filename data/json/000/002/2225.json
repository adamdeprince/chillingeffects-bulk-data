Please provide all future correspondence on this issue to us. After review of your letter of October 10, 2003, to William Doherty, OPG respectfully declines to remove the IndyMedia pages you reference therein. \r\n\r\nFirst, OPG is merely providing co-location to IndyMedia, which in turn is only providing hyperlinks to materials you claim infringe Diebold copyrights. In other words, OPG does not host the Diebold materials and neither does IndyMedia. There is merely an address for the information on the IndyMedia website as source material for a news story. Linking is not among the exclusive rights granted by the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.
