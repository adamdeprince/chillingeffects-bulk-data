Hansen recently learned that Onecle, Inc. posted, without Hansen s knowledge or consent, and apparently without any other authorization, an Aseptic Packaging Agreement between Hansen and Johanna Foods, Inc. (the  Agreement ) as a sample contract on its website.  The following URL provides access to the Agreement:\r\n\r\nhttp://contracts.onecle.com/hansen/johanna.mfg.2000.12.07.shtml\r\n\r\nThis letter serves as Hansen s notification to Onecle, Inc. under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) that Onecle, Inc. is infringing on Hansen s copyrights.  Hansen hereby requests that Onecle, Inc. remove and disable access to the Agreement from its website and refrain from posting any similar material on its website in the future.\r\n\r\nHansen has a good faith belief that use of the Agreement in the manner described above is not authorized by Hansen, its agent, or the law.
