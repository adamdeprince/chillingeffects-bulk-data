Mutual fund trades are $9.95 (same as Zecco and Firstrade), they\u2019re easy to reach over the phone, and they offer Live Chat via their site. They\u2019ve also got a broker comparison table, which all online brokers like to show to put themselves in the best possible light. Their table shows that their trading commissions are better than many brokers\u2019 (for regular trades) but they\u2019re missing that nice community feature that\u2019s available on sites like Zecco or TradeKing. But open an account with them and you could get your transfer fees reimbursed up to $100. They also have an ongoing promotion right now that\u2019s good for a limited time: 100 free stock trades for new accounts.\r\n\r\nScottrade charges $7 per stock trade online, but will charge more for phone and broker assisted trades. These are great prices, but I actually appreciate their mutual fund fees even more! For mutual funds with an NTF designation (no load and no transaction fee), your transactions are completely free. However, no load funds that aren\u2019t in the NTF program have a fee of $17 for each trade, whether you buy, sell or exchange. Something similar is applied to loaded funds and broker assisted transactions with mutual funds, so you\u2019ll get the best deal by sticking to managing your portfolio online. From the feedback I\u2019ve heard about Scottrade, they\u2019re a well-established, highly popular broker that\u2019s a great fit for the retail investor.","infringing_urls":[{"url":"http://onlinebrokers.ws/OnlineBrokerRatings/1-online-broker"}],"copyrighted_urls":[{"url":"http://www.thedigeratilife.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/09/best-online-stock-brokers-cheap-stock-trades-online-discount-brokers/"}]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
