At the request of [private], the attorney for [private], we removed two documents you had posted on Scribd.  [Private] and his attorney stated that the documents had been posted in an effort to harass [private].  As you know, while court documents are in the public record, our Terms of Use bar users from posting harassing documents.  Scribd does not know the facts of what is apparently an ongoing dispute involving [private], so we have removed the documents at his attorney's request.\r\n\r\nWe apologize for any inconvenience or confusion.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\n[Private]\r\n[Quoted text hidden]\r\n-- \r\n[Private]\r\nDirector, Community Development @ Scribd\r\n[Private]\r\nhttp://scribd.com  \r\n","date_sent":"2008-05-22T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2008-05-22T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","Protest, Parody and Criticism Sites"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Scribd/NULL","recipient_name":"Circlesphere","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
