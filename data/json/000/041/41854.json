The Sprint Nextel Law Department sent an e-mail to\r\nthe site's administrative contact, Jeff Lorenzo at domains@pcspromotions.com\r\non November 11, 2005 demanding cessation of these activities.  Mr. Lorenzo\r\nresponded and acknowledged that they do not have a license to use the Sprint\r\nproperty.  Sprint replied that in the absence of a license, 877 PCS\r\nPromotions will have to cease using Sprint-owned trademarks and trade dress.\r\nThe company has not responded and has not complied as of the date of this\r\ncomplaint.  Copies of these communications and a printout of their home page\r\nthat clearly uses the Sprint Property is attached in support.  \r\n\r\n1.

The\r\ninformation in this statement / notification is accurate to the best of my\r\ninformation, knowledge and belief. I state and certify under penalty of\r\nperjury that Sprint Communications Company L.P. has a good faith belief that\r\nuse of the Sprint Property as described in this complaint is not authorized\r\nby the owner or any of its agents and therefore infringes on Sprint's\r\nintellectual property rights.  \r\n\r\n877 PCS Promotions' activities infringe on Sprint's intellectual property\r\nrights and appear to violate theplanet.com's policies.   Accordingly Sprint\r\nasks theplanet.com and/or Kangaroo Partners to contact the infringer and\r\ndemand that they stop engaging in this misrepresentation and infringement\r\nand/or disable access to their site.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours, \r\n\r\nElena Powell \r\nSr. Legal Analyst \r\nSprint Nextel \r\n6450 Sprint Parkway, KSOPHN0312-3A500 \r\nOverland Park,  KS  66251 \r\n\r\n\r\n<<pcspromocorresp.pdf>> <<pcspromorecord.pdf>> \r\n","date_sent":"2005-12-05T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-12-05T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Sprint Nextel","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
