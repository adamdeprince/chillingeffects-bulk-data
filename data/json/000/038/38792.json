In more detail, here are some examples of\r\ncopyrighted material they have copied:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1) Their help page is an exact copy of our help page, including all\r\ntext, bold attributes, and words in ALL CAPS.  Only the name of the site\r\nis changed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) On the main page, the left column is links to magazines by price\r\n(with the same price ranges that we use) and links to categories.  The\r\nmain part of the page includes some general text telling how many\r\nmagazines, merchants, and coupons are tracked, plus a sampling of\r\nmagazines, six with cover images and the rest as just text.  This is\r\nexactly how our main page has looked since 2003, with the exception of\r\nprice ranges, which we added in 2004.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) They have sections of the site for the most popular magazines, recent\r\nprice drops, a merchant list, coupons, and magazine packages.  These are\r\nour major sections as well.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4) The coupons they have listed are mostly exclusive coupons that the\r\nmerchants have provided to MagazinePriceSearch.com.  A partial list of\r\nthem include MPS15 and MPS1575 from BestDealMagazines.com, MPS5 and\r\nMPS15 from Deekins.com, DCMPS5 and several others from NetMagazines.com.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5) On the magazine detail pages, they list all of the descriptions from\r\nall of the merchants, which is exactly what we have done since 2003.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou should be able to easily see that the information is has been copied\r\nfrom MagazinePriceSearch.com.  You can also use the Wayback machine\r\n(http://web.archive.org <http://web.archive.org/> ) to verify that our\r\nsite has looked like it does since 2003.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you have trouble verifying any of this information, please contact\r\nme:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMichael Coley\r\n\r\nMagazinePriceSearch.com\r\n\r\nmcoley@magazinepricesearch.com\r\n\r\nPO Box 1020\r\n\r\nMansfield, TX 76063\r\n\r\n817-561-4896\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe infringer does not and never has had authorization to use the\r\nmaterial in this way.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI affirm that this information is accurate and that I am the owner of\r\nsaid copyrights.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n/s/ Michael Coley\r\n","date_sent":"2007-08-16T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-08-16T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"MagazinePriceSearch.com","recipient_name":"Theplanet.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
