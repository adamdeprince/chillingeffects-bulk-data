Please call me next week at your convenience, if you want to. I would want to find out if there is something you are upset with Yahoo! about, that I might be able to help you resolve.  Otherwise, I appreciate your contacting GoDaddy and will close this file for now. Again, thanks for your honesty and willingness to work with me.\r\n \r\nKind regards,\r\n \r\njonathan matkowsky |  legal director |  Yahoo!

Below is my direct dial so we can talk -- I hate to see someone so upset with Yahoo!.  Also, I appreciate your email, and will not pursue this any further for now, if you would have GoDaddy remove the advertisement from the page that is currently being displayed.
