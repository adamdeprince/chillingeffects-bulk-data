Should you not take immediate action on\r\nthis matter, you are exposing yourselves to impending legal action from\r\nour group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are a host of the product ?Mind Power Studio? and ?Subliminal Mind\r\nPower?, located online respectively at http://www.mindpowerstudio.com/\r\nand http://www.subliminalmindpower.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur group, White Cliff Computing Ltd, initially copyrighted both the\r\nsales text and software for this product back in 2001. We have been\r\nretailing the product online since that date. The product can be\r\ncurrently found online at http://www.subliminal-power.com/ and as a\r\nwhite label product at http://www.brainbullet.com/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ?Subliminal Mind Power? and ?Mind Power Studio? are not authorized\r\nwhite label productions. Unfortunately one of your users has reproduced\r\nour products and is selling through your channels. The seller appears to\r\nbe an existing customer, who has duplicated both the established\r\nSubliminal Power product and many of its affirmations. In addition, it\r\nis in violation of copyright infringement, trademark infringement,\r\npassing off, and plagiarism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have sent a CEASE & DESIST to the individual (attached, for your\r\nreference), however they are utilizing ?masking? with their host at\r\nGoDaddy.com, to help protect their identity. We initially discovered the\r\ninfringement in March 2006 and contacted the owner, however we have\r\nreceived no replies to our messages. We believe the infringer to be a Mr\r\nAlan Cooper, of the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo correct this problem, you will need to stop the individual hosting\r\nthe said pages through yourselves. You will also need to remove the\r\nprogram and all copyrighted sales text from your site. In addition, we\r\nwould appreciate any further information you may have regarding this\r\nmatter, so we can file for damages through the legal system, however we\r\nare aware this would be a condition of goodwill on your behalf only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly begin your investigations as soon as possible. We will allow\r\nseven days from the e-mail date. I would appreciate you keeping me\r\nup-to-date on this matter, by e-mailing james.dunn@whitecliff.net\r\n<mailto:james.dunn@whitecliff.net>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs per statutory requirements: I have a good faith belief that use of\r\nthe copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing\r\nweb pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the\r\nlaw. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the\r\nnotification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is\r\nallegedly infringed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Dunn, Legal Services\r\n\r\nWhite Cliff Computing Ltd\r\n\r\n\r\n- --\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPolicy Enforcement\r\nThe Planet Internet Services, Inc.\r\nhttp://www.theplanet.com/legal/aup.html\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.2 (MingW32)\r\nComment: Using GnuPG with Mozilla - http://enigmail.mozdev.org\r\n\r\niD8DBQFEX5SbvK/XpJs6oyURAuN9AJ9LyvGpc/zkTcaclhoCHHPXCRBqQQCdGzXj\r\n4Ni2HI7Tvs5SxCzUTWOdywM=\r\n=KVrq\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2006-05-08T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-05-08T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"White Cliff Computing Ltd","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
