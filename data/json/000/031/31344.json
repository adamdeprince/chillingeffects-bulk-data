The RIAA is a trade\r\nassociation whose member companies create, manufacture and distribute\r\napproximately ninety (90) percent of all legitimate sound recordings sold in\r\nthe United States.  Under penalty of perjury, we submit that the RIAA is\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of its member companies in matters involving the\r\ninfringement of their sound recordings, including enforcing their copyrights\r\nand common law rights on the Internet.   \r\n\r\nWe believe your service is hosting the above-referenced site on your\r\nnetwork. This site offers hundreds of sound files for download.  Many of\r\nthese files contain recordings owned by our member companies, including\r\nsongs by the artists known as Dem Franchise Boyz, Three Six Mafia, Lloyd\r\nBanks and Elephant Man.
