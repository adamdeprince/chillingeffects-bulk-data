In addition to the large list of stolen graphics above, the text has also been copied. Another blog entry, http://thekidzpage.blogspot.com/2007/02/free-kids-games-colouring-jigsaw.htm, is also riddled with stolen graphics and text. I have taken screenshots for personal reference and can send them to you if further information is required. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the website that the blog entry links to is, as of April 2, 2007 when this letter was written, a website that is nearly a 100% copy of theKidzpage.com, both in written word as well as accompanying graphics. The only apparent differences are that links beginning with thekidzpage.com have been replaced with wisam.dk, the ad code has been replaced with alternate ad code (including Google Adsense ads), and the copyright statement has been altered to credit the imposter.\r\n \r\n3.
