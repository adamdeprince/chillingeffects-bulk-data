I live in Marina Del Rey.  ICANN is down the street. \r\n \r\nWhat is the contact information of your billing records? \r\nI want to see the complete billing records for both web sites.  It may have changed\r\nseveral times. \r\nI want to know who or whom have paid the bills and administered the site. \r\nI want all the relevent information that would be needed to identify who the bastard\r\nis.  And investigate whether they are the same person or connected. \r\nThe fact that both sites are hosted by your service leads me to believe they are\r\nconnected. \r\n \r\nI work freelance.  Clients Google me to establish my credentials.  This smut has\r\nhurt my career.  Destroyed my retirement funding.  Slandered an ex-Marine.  And\r\ncause a former NYC resident who witnessed the events of 9/11 great emotional pain. \r\n \r\nI hope you will cooperate. \r\n \r\nAlso \u00ad cease and desist hosting steadipimp.com. \r\n \r\nThank-you\r\nMatthew Chubet SOC\r\nhttp://www.matthewchubet.com\r\n310.991.0791 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nMIME element (text/html)\r\n<HTML>\r\n<HEAD>\r\n<TITLE>Slander</TITLE>\r\n</HEAD>\r\n<BODY>\r\n<FONT FACE=\"Verdana, Helvetica, Arial\"><SPAN STYLE='font-size:12.0px'>Hello -<BR>\r\n<BR> My name is Matthew Chubet.<BR> <BR> You formerly hosted a web site which\r\nslanders me &#8211; and currently host a web site which slanders me.<BR> <BR>\r\nSinefaring.com and Steadipimp.com<BR> <BR> If you google my name, Matthew Chubet,\r\nyou find a cached web page with a very high relevency which uses my name as the\r\nembedded html title - <IMG src=\"cid:3240474306_847118\" ><BR> It&#8217;s a bunch of\r\ngibberish &#8211; but potential clients will only have seen Google&#8217;s summary\r\n&#8211; viagra, finasteride, pharmacy.<BR> <BR> And, if you google search steadipimp\r\n&#8211; you will find business directories which still link me to steadipimp - a\r\nformer url which was not authorized to be transferred or auctioned, yet was\r\ntransferred and auctioned by google.<BR> <BR> Steadipimp.com is a very sick and\r\ntwisted porn site full of granny sex and stuff like that.<BR> <BR> Please cooperate\r\nwith me. &nbsp;I live in Marina Del Rey. &nbsp;ICANN is down the street.<BR> <BR>\r\nWhat is the contact information of your billing records?<BR> I want to see the\r\ncomplete billing records for both web sites. &nbsp;It may have changed several\r\ntimes.<BR> I want to know who or whom have paid the bills and administered the\r\nsite.<BR> I want all the relevent information that would be needed to identify who\r\nthe bastard is. &nbsp;And investigate whether they are the same person or\r\nconnected.<BR> The fact that both sites are hosted by your service leads me to\r\nbelieve they are connected.<BR> <BR> I work freelance. &nbsp;Clients Google me to\r\nestablish my credentials. &nbsp;This smut has hurt my career. &nbsp;Destroyed my\r\nretirement funding. &nbsp;Slandered an ex-Marine. &nbsp;And cause a former NYC\r\nresident who witnessed the events of 9/11 great emotional pain.<BR> <BR> I hope you\r\nwill cooperate.<BR> <BR> Also &#8211; cease and desist hosting steadipimp.com.<BR>\r\n<BR> Thank-you<BR> Matthew Chubet SOC<BR> <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.matthewchubet.com\">http://www.matthewchubet.com</a><BR>\r\n310.991.0791<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n</SPAN></FONT>\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML> \r\n \r\n \r\nMIME element (text/plain)\r\nMIME element (application/pdf)\r\nMIME element (text/plain)\r\n\r\n\r\n","date_sent":"2006-09-07T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-09-07T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":null,"recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
