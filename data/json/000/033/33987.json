Piano on the Net is\r\nlocated at: \r\nhttp://www.pianonanny.com/ \r\n \r\nPiano on the Net has won many awards and has been featured on the NBC\r\nNightly News (June 1998), CNN (October 1997), and in WebMaster (now CIO)\r\nMagazine (August 1997). \r\n \r\nI have tried to contact him several times, but he refuses to answer. \r\n \r\nSince he is hosting this stolen content on your servers, I was hoping\r\nyou would be able to contact him and talk to him about removing it from\r\nyour servers. \r\n \r\nYour help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. \r\n \r\nI thought a \"Swami\" was supposed to be a holy man? I guess you don't\r\nhave to be an honest holy man if you're from India. \r\n \r\nThank you. \r\n \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\n \r\nClint Clark\r\nAuthor and owner of Piano on the Net \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nClint Clark \r\n \r\nWeb Designer /Consultant\r\nThe Art Department\r\nwww.pianonanny.com/portfolio/\r\nclint.clark.email@gmail.com\r\n(319) 504-2932 \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n","date_sent":"2006-10-27T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2006-10-27T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Piano on the Net","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
