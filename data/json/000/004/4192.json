Your blacklist and use of the above domain name violates the Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.), because it infringes and dilutes our trademark. Infringement occurs when a third party's use of another's trademark (or a confusingly similar variation thereof) is likely to confuse consumers as to the affiliation; sponsorship or endorsements of the third party","date_sent":"2004-12-06T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-12-06T05:00:00Z","topics":["ACPA","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"www.bargainfindsonebay.com","recipient_name":"DeDanaan.com","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
