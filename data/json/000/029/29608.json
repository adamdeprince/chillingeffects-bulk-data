They do not have a model release, which\r\nis against federal law and also a requirement for hosting such pictures. We\r\nare in the process of pursuing legal matters but I wanted to inform you so\r\nyou were not caught in any legal actions we take and also so that these\r\npictures will be taken down as soon as possible.\r\nI spoke with one of your representatives, Mickey, and he assured me your\r\nhelp on this matter. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nAlso, my photos are also located on other sites hosted by you,\r\nwww.asphericash.com <http://www.asphericash.com> and www.myplanetgirls.com\r\n<http://www.myplanetgirls.com>.
