It's a request from\r\nyou company to force your client manage his site according to international\r\nlaws. I think that's one of the documents all of us sign before we get on\r\nboard with hosts.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nM.

It took us several months to convince him to\r\nremove those materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow he has taken our Copyrighted Graphic images which have been created by\r\nour team and posted them on his site www.ahadees.com\r\n<http://www.ahadees.com/> after removing the stamps from them. We have been\r\nfare enough to offer him to keep the images on his site but without any\r\nalterations and have send him many emails but have not received any\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are ready to take legal action towards this site and the owner of this\r\nsite Mr. Syed Muhammad Fahad Akhtar. If no action has been taken from your\r\nend on this issue your company would be added to the law suit since this\r\nsite resides on your server. We want to resolve this issue peacefully and\r\ndon't want to proceed with the law suit if the defendant removes images from\r\nthe site or use them as is. But if this issue has not been resolved by him\r\nOr you within seven days we would be forced to proceed with legal action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing are the links of the pages:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur page which has the originals:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.islamicacademy.org/html/Islamic%20Images/Islamic%20Images.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAhadees.com's page with altered images:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ahadees.com/galleries/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammad Tahir Shafi Qaderi\r\nAlmajma-ul-Islami\r\nwww.islamicacademy.org <http://www.islamicacademy.org> Dedicated to Increase\r\nyour Islamic Knowledge -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFCi+LRvK/XpJs6oyURAh7KAJ9MlxQWyjkhYmrdQw81HS5I4Xk+xACgkdy2\r\n0ZZXOa5kexKXZnrHpJAKfmM=\r\n=RglR\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","date_sent":"2005-05-18T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-05-18T04:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Almajma-ul-Islami","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services Inc","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
