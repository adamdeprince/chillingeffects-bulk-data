As INTEGRITYSERVERS.NET has no contact details or a\r\nwebpage, I have had to resort to contacting you - Their network/datacenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spent months chasing down hosts to remove a specific site which goes\r\nby the name of www.krewz.tk (http://www.wwe-live.com/krewzhosting). The\r\nowner of this site has made it purposely to damage our trademark (Habbo).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.habbohotel.co.uk is an online graphical chat and gaming environment for\r\nteenagers. The site takes the form of a virtual hotel, where each user is\r\nrepresented by an avatar called a Habbo. Habbos can walk, talk and dance in\r\nall of the hotel's public and private rooms. Private rooms are created by\r\nthe Habbos themselves and are furnished by them using Habbo Credits. Users\r\npurchase Habbo Credits using all the normal online payment methods, such as\r\ncredit or debit cards, reverse SMS billing, premium rate phone lines and\r\ncheques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese people are dedicating their lives to damaging our company either by\r\nharassing our employees, creating scripts to interfere with our game,\r\ninfringing copyright, rioting within our game and disrupting other users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir recent attempt to damage our brand has resulted in this website. The\r\nsite contains video of Sulake staff which they are not permitted to have in\r\ntheir possession or publish. The video was not published to the public on\r\nthe internet and is personal property. Please understand that we wish to\r\nkeep the details of our employee's private and protect them in anyway we\r\ncan. We promote online safety and encourage our users to never post their\r\npictures online. However, the people running this site are making it\r\ndifficult for us to do our jobs as they have being digging around old\r\ndocuments and personal sites that are over two years old in order to find\r\nour personal info. They have no permission to publish these videos or any\r\ninfo in connection to Habbo/Sulake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe site also contains documents (\"handbooks\") belonging to Sulake Labs.\r\nThey are located under \"classified\" in the website\r\n(http://www.wwe-live.com/krewzhosting/classified.html). These documents are\r\nprotected by copyright and only specific people are allowed to have these\r\ndocuments (paid employees, Hotel guides). This means that they were obtained\r\nunlawfully by the creators of the site and they have now published them\r\nwhich not only infringes copyright but is actual theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not allow our customers to use any 3rd party tools or scripting\r\nsoftware and any user found using such scripts are barred from our site. The\r\nsite owner has created/published scripts for other users to download and use\r\nwithin Habbo. This is damaging to our company and since these programs are\r\nmade for the sole purpose of disrupting Habbo, we feel that they should be\r\nterminated from this website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe web site is breaking the following rules stated on your Acceptable Use\r\nPolicy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  a..
