URL: http://flexgirls.thumblogger.com/ 2. IP: 69.57.144.70\r\n\r\nOn the screenshot1.jpg you can clearly see that the link in banner's\r\n\"element properties\" leads to my website which is\r\nwww.fashionpoint.co.uk.\r\nThe banner which I'm talking about is circled in RED in screenshot1.jpg.\r\nBut if you click on that link browser will take you to\r\nhttp://flexgirls.thumblogger.com which is not my website at all! The guy\r\njust stole my banner!! Please take some measures - this is your clients\r\ntaking hosting from you.  He uses my intellectual property without my\r\npermission!","date_sent":"2007-01-10T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2007-01-10T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"studio@fashionpoint.co.uk","recipient_name":"ThePlanet Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
