The copied material includes, but is not limited to, custom page graphics purchased by The Davidson Institute for Talent Development under contract with a graphic designer, a company logo purchased by The Davidson Institute for Talent Development under contract with a graphic designer, company name and a copyright graphic at the bottom of all offending pages. The content copied is material that we have either produced ourselves, obtained written permission to reproduce or have paid to reproduce on our website at www.ditd.org.\r\n\r\nSince they have copied nearly all of our content, it would be tedious and extremely difficult to ascertain where each of the pages on www.thaigifted.org shows up on your search pages. One for example is seen rather clearly when you go to Google.com and search for 'GT Cybersource'. The link to that search results page is: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=GT+Cybersource. As you can see, the top two records are ours. The third record Is from www.thaigifted.org. This occurs with roughly 500+ records when you do a search for article content an our site\r\n\r\nIncluded with this letter, you will find an additional document that has screen shots of more of the articles as they appear on the www.thaigifted.org website and the immediate pages to of navigation to get to the offending articles.\r\n\r\nAll material that has been stolen is located at www.thaigifted.org/general/g1a.html. You will see two columns. The left column is in Thai and the right column is in English. All offending articles are located within the navigation on the right side of the page. If you navigate to Acceleration' -> 'A case for acceleration Hultgren, Holly', you will see this page, www.thaigifted.org/general/website/Acceration/ac1.htm. This is an exact replica of the page as it appears on our website at www.ditd.org.\r\n\r\nWe have made numerous attempts to contact the owners of the website via the e-mail links we can read, but the e-mail messages have either been bounced or we have not gotten any responses. We have run a detailed WHOIS report and contacted their registrar, their upstream bandwidth provider, and anyone else we could get an e-mail address for from the WHOIS report. We include a copy of the WHOIS report that we have obtained.\r\n\r\nI have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law. Furthermore, I swear, under penalty of perjury consistent with United States Code Title 17, Section 512, that the information in this notification is accurate and that The Davidson Institute of Talent Development is the copyright owner or is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\r\n\r\nPage 2 \tDecember 8, 2003\r\n\r\nI note that The Davidson Group is an affiliate of The Davidson Institude of Talent Development and is authorized to act on its behalf with respect to this matter.\r\n\r\nAttachments:\r\n\r\nDocument Subject: Screenshots of stolen website content from www.thaigifted.org.
