{"dmca":{"id":5766,"type":"Dmca","title":"Subpoena Report","body":"My ISP 169.229.73.67.\r\nI did not realize that downloading was illegal, because my friend told me that DC++ was legal in campus residences.  When she downloaded it she didn't tell me their was any sort of disclaimer. I never used DC++ and so when I let a friend onto my computer he went onto the i2hub.  I didn't even know what an i2hub is nor did I know what he was doing.  I don't think this changes anything, especially since the RIAA probably doesn't care.  I had it on my computer and I was too stupid to know what it was.  Anyways, I thought you might want some background information on my non-existent file sharing past.  This particular batch of students they are suing now seems to be very random and nothing to do with the student's history of file sharing.
