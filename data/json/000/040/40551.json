Having spoken to a legal  \nadvisor, I am aware that the written content and the published stolen  \nimages clearly qualify as defamation of character. The above material also\n \nclearly violates my basic human right to privacy.\nThe sites feel that they can keep this material visible because they know \n\nthat I would need to pay for an injunction to remove it, which as a young \n\nperson, I cannot afford. I have suffered for five years as a result of  \nthese images on the internet. These two sites now appear to be the only  \nremaining publishers of them. Their continued persecution is wrong and  \nillegal. I would therefore like your help in removing the URL's from your \n\nsearch results.
