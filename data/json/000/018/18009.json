We believe that the Internet access of the user engaging in this\r\ninfringement is provided by Optimum Online (Cablevision Systems) or a\r\ndownstream service provider who purchases this connectivity from Optimum\r\nOnline (Cablevision Systems).  \r\n \r\n This unauthorized copying and distribution constitutes copyright\r\ninfringement under Section 106 of the U.S. Copyright Act.  Depending upon\r\nthe type of service Optimum Online (Cablevision Systems) is providing to\r\nthis IP address, it may have legal and/or equitable liability if it does\r\nnot expeditiously remove or disable access to the motion picture(s) listed\r\nbelow, or if it fails to implement a policy that provides for termination\r\nof subscribers who are repeat infringers (see 17 U.S.C. 512).\r\n \r\n Despite the above, NBC Universal believes that the entire Internet\r\ncommunity benefits when these matters are resolved cooperatively. We urge\r\nyou to take immediate action to stop this infringing activity and inform\r\nus of the results of your actions.
