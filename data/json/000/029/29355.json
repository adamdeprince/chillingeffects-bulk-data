(Mikeinc.net's\r\nresponse to one: \"NO! ... show me the copyright orginals and video then I\r\nwill Enjoy the pictures guys\") As I'm sure you're aware, nothing in\r\ncopyright law requires the copyright holder to present original copies(which\r\nI'm not even sure what that means in the case of digital photographs) to\r\nrequest their removal after being distributed illegally.\r\n\r\n\r\nMikeinc.net: This is the last friendly request we will make to keep our\r\nproperty and the trading of our property off your site. If we see any more\r\nmaterials belonging to Camwhores.com on Mikeinc.net, we will not hesitate to\r\npursue further legal action, including suing for damages (up to $150,000 per\r\nwork infringed) as well as requesting the shutdown of your site allowed\r\nunder the DMCA.\r\n\r\n\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Four days have passed with no response from the owners of mikeinc.net  \r\n> regarding our previous notice to them.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> We are amending this complaint to include additional images   \r\n> discovered on the mikeinc.net website that the copyrights are owned  \r\n> by CamWhores.com:\r\n>\r\n> http://www,mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_images/photoalbum/59.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/Kitty03%\r\n> 5B222%5D%5B606%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/\r\n> Kitty022% 5B381%5D%5B607%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/Kitty01%\r\n> 5B220%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/Kitty02%\r\n> 5B221%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/Kitty03%\r\n> 5B222%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/Kitty04%\r\n> 5B223%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/\r\n> Kitty021% 5B380%5D.jpg\r\n> http://www.mikeinc.net/cam-girls/fusion_public/attachments/\r\n> Kitty022% 5B381%5D.jpg\r\n>\r\n> We demand that all images be removed immediately.\r\n>\r\n> If all images are not removed by 5pm Eastern Time on August 8th,   \r\n> 2005, further actions will be taken by us.
