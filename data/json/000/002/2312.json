Interest, Discount, and Markups\r\n\r\nThe interest, I,earned on the amount, P, of money invested depends on the interest rate, i, and the time, T, the money is invested- This is represented by the equation\r\n\r\nI=PiT\r\n\r\nThe interest would be the dollars earned (or paid), the interest rate is always the annual interest rate (unless otherwise stated), and the time is measured in years, Simple interest means that the interest, I, is determined using the total time period, e.g. 10 years, rather than compounding the interest, that is, adding the interest, I, to the amount, P, after each year.\r\n\r\nDiscount is the percent reduced on the price of an item. Markup is the amount of increase when the cost of an Item is increased a certain percent. The following examples will illustrate this concept.\r\n\r\nFor markups and discounts, calculate:\r\n\r\n\tNew Price - Original\r\n\tOriginal\r\n\r\nIf the value is negative, that is the amount of the discount. If the number is positive, that is the amount of the markup \r\n\r\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n\r\n[similar lengthy material redacted]\r\n\r\n\r\n3.
