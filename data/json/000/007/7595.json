I am not guilty and do not know what to do. The letter states I have 21 days to fight this, to prevent comcast from having to submit my name and address. Reads as follows:\r\nThe RIAA has filed several lawsuits in the United States Disctrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of its major record company members. You have been sued in one of these lawsuits for infringing RIAA member coyrights on the internet by uploading and/or dowloadig music using a computer assigned the Internet protocal address ##### on 05/28/05 at 11:21pm EDT. the Court has ordered Comcast to supply your name and address and other information to the RIAA. If you have questions consult an attorney immediately. You have 21 days to provide a filing of a motion to quash or vacate the subpoena by 08/26/05. If you don't Comcast will have to provide you name and address to the directed Order.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do? Ihave done nothing illegal, I have no money for attorneys fees, I do not even know how to download music. My son's do have itunes on our computer and have paid for downloaded songs. This has to be a mistake, accident, or data error. Please advise!\r\nThank You","date_sent":"2005-06-29T04:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-06-29T04:00:00Z","topics":["DMCA Subpoenas","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"RIAA","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
