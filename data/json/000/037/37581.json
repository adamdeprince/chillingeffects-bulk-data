Specifically, these \r\nsales have been seen on http://l2.hsclan.com which resolves to 67.19.61.170 on the ThePlanet.com \r\nInternet Services, Inc. Additionally, proprietary Lineage 2 server files are being hosted at \r\nftp://l2:l2@l2.hsclan.com/L2C1Patch.zip, also on the ThePlanet Internet Services. Further, hsclan.com is \r\nthe actual server address for actually hosting an illegal Lineage 2 private server. This, if true, is being \r\ndone in violation of Federal copyright law.   As you may be aware, this type of activity may represent a \r\ndirect infringement of the copyright law and would be punishable under law. \r\n \r\nThe consequences of copyright infringement can be severe.  The copyright law allows the copyright \r\nowner to recover either (1) its actual damages plus all of the infringer\u2019s profits that are attributable to the \r\ninfringement, or (2) statutory damages of up to $100,000 per copyright. The law also provides for the \r\nseizure and impoundment (a) of all infringing copies, and (b) of the equipment that was used to make the \r\ninfringing copies.  Injunctive relief is routinely awarded to the copyright owner, and the law permits the \r\nprevailing party to recover its attorney\u2019s fees. \r\n \r\nWe have contacted you, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) to make you aware of this activity and \r\nthe liability this site are placing upon you.  Many ISPs have agreed to cancel accounts of those violating \r\nagreements with a third party or copyright infringers and to remove and preserve as evidence any files \r\nstored on their server owned by a violator or an infringer.   \r\n \r\nAs a result of the above, we require that you immediately do the following: \r\n \r\n1. Cease and desist any and all actual or intended hosting or dissemination of client/server files \r\nand/or or other copyrighted material (collectively, the \u201cContent\u201d); \r\n2. Disable all websites hosting or disseminating the Content; and \r\n3. Provide written verification of the above to us within three (3) days of receipt of this letter. \r\n \r\nWe will be monitoring the above referenced website to see if you are in compliance with the law, the \r\nend user license agreement and the rules of conduct.  We reserve all of our rights and remedies provided \r\nby law.  \r\n \r\nWe urge you to give this matter your prompt and serious attention, and we look forward to your \r\nimmediate response.  Please direct your response to William Leverett of NCsoft Corporation by Tuesday, \r\nDecember 14, 2004, at iprights@ncsoft.com. If we do not hear from you by that time, we will consider all \r\nalternatives available in order to protect our rights.  \r\n \r\n \r\nSincerely, \r\n \r\nWilliam Leverett \r\nNCsoft Corporation \r\nAustin, Texas \r\niprights@ncsoft.com \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n===8<===========End of original message text===========\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: GnuPG v1.2.5 (MingW32)\r\n\r\niD8DBQFBtiTWvK/XpJs6oyURAjUZAJ4+j5xMmUkcSSh4p3DQvRgZ93K5sACgm2DJ\r\nCXHhaXzrrvdYdTVFP7y99Mk=\r\n=Js20\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","date_sent":"2004-12-07T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2004-12-07T05:00:00Z","topics":["Copyright","DMCA Safe Harbor"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"NC Soft Corporation","recipient_name":"ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc.","works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
