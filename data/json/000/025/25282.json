We have recently learned that a website you are\r\ndirectly or indirectly hosting on your servers, videocodezone.com, is\r\nviolating Music Video Net's website MusicVideoCodes.com copyrights, pending\r\ntrademark, and patent pending marks. \r\n \r\nOur original copyrighted material can be found here:\r\n <http://www.musicvideocodes.com/> http://www.musicvideocodes.com\r\n \r\nAlso, our Patent Pending application number 60/666614 is being violated.\r\n \r\nPursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (\"DMCA\"), we are writing to\r\nprovide you notice of the website you are hosting which is conducting\r\nillegal activities and copyright infringement. Acting as an agent on behalf\r\nof Music Video Net Inc. and MusicVideoCodes.com, I have a good faith belief\r\nthat the use of musicvideocodes.com's copyrighted material in this manner is\r\nnot authorized by us, our agent, or the law.\r\n \r\nvideocodezone.com\r\nIs hosted by your services per their IP Address (67.19.210.162)\r\nhttp://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=videocodezone.com\r\nWhich is hosted by:\r\nhttp://www.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=67.19.210.162\r\n\r\nThe organization you are hosting (videocodezone.com) conduct constitutes\r\nwillful copyright infringement and unfair competition and is damaging Music\r\nVideo Net Inc.'s, MusicVideoCodes.com, our customers and our advertisers.\r\n \r\nMusic Video Net Inc.'s and MusicVideoCodes.com hereby asking that you remove\r\nall content and services, and materials from your servers that was copied\r\nfrom MusicVideoCodes.com. We insist that you confirm that your client has\r\nceased all acts of infringement and destroyed all infringing materials\r\nwithin 5 days' of your receipt of this letter.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, Music Video Net Inc. and MusicVideoCodes.com has a pending\r\ntrademark with the USPTO for the registered mark \"Music Video Code(s)\" (the\r\n\"Mark\"), which has been in continuous use in interstate commerce since the\r\nworld-renowned website entitled \"MusicVideoCodes.com\" was first published in\r\n2004. Music Video Net Inc. is the exclusive licensee of the publishing and\r\nmerchandising rights to the Mark in connection with the internet and all\r\nrelated collateral products and services (collectively, the \"Music Video\r\nCodes Properties\"). As I am sure you are aware, MusicVideoCodes.com is quite\r\nprobably the most famous website ever published in conjuction with providing\r\nMusic Video Codes (a term and service which we have created) to bloggers and\r\nprofile users. MusicVideoCodes.com is ranked 6th in visitor traffic by\r\nNielsen//NetRatings\r\nhttp://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/charts/internet/music.jsp Indeed,\r\nmillions of pageviews of the various music videos on the website have taken\r\nplace since first publication. As a result of this enormous number of\r\npageviews and the attendant publicity, the public associates the Mark and\r\nits distinctive logo solely with Music Video Net Inc. and\r\nMusicVideoCodes.com.\r\n \r\nIt has come to our attention that videocodezone.com has been using our\r\npending trademark, \"Music Video Code(s)\", throughout their website to\r\npromote our patent pending service, which provides users with \"Music Video\r\nCodes\" to display on their blogs or profiles. We continue to be very\r\nconcerned about their use of our pending trademark and pending patent as it\r\nconstitutes an improper association, which trades on the goodwill and\r\nreputation of Music Video Net Inc. and is likely to cause confusion with\r\nthose Properties and applicable federal and local laws. As it is our\r\nobligation to protect our intellectual property rights, we must request that\r\nyour clicent cease all use of the our patent pending service of providing\r\n\"Music Video Codes\" for users to display on their blogs or profiles, or any\r\nconfusingly similar properties in connection with your website or otherwise,\r\nand that you refrain from registering any confusingly similar domains,\r\nproducts, or services in the future.\r\n \r\nIn specific, videocodezone.com has copied our actual HTML Code from our page\r\nto give visitors to their website which is to be used to embed a music video\r\nonto the visitor's blog or website pages (this actual HTML CODE is detailed\r\nin our patent pending documents):\r\n \r\nOriginal Material Found On:\r\nhttp://www.musicvideocodes.com/?song=1863\r\nFound on every song page of our site below each music video in the HTML Code\r\nbox.\r\n \r\nOriginal Material which is included in our patent pending is:\r\n \r\n<div id=vpdiv><embed style=\"FILTER: xray\" name=\"RAOCXplayer\"\r\nsrc=\"http://song.musicvideocodes.com/song.php?s=1863\"\r\ntype=\"application/x-mplayer2\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" ShowControls=\"1\"\r\nShowStatusBar=\"0\" AutoSize=\"true\" loop=\"true\" EnableContextMenu=\"0\"\r\npluginspage=\"http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/Downloads/Contents/Products/Me\r\ndiaPlayer/\"\r\n<http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/Downloads/Contents/Products/MediaPlayer/>\r\n></embed></div>Video code provided by <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.musicvideocodes.com\" <http://www.musicvideocodes.com>\r\n>Music Video Codes</a>\r\n \r\n \r\nThe Infringing Work:\r\n  Found On:\r\n  http://videocodezone.com/ \r\n  (Click on the URL 'badfish')\r\n  Also, every link in the center content area of their site is hyperlinked\r\nto javascript to display our original work in the square boxes to the right.\r\n \r\n<div id=vpdiv><a href='http://www.VideoCodeZone.com'><embed\r\nname='RAOCXplayer' src='http://x2.musicvideocodes.com/44//7309292372.asf'\r\ntype='application/x-mplayer2' width='300' height='300' ShowControls='1'\r\nShowStatusBar='0' loop='true' EnableContextMenu='0' DisplaySize='0'\r\npluginspage='http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/Downloads/Contents/Products/Me\r\ndiaPlayer/'></embed></div><font style='font-size: 10pt;'>Music Video Codes\r\nBy VideoCodeZone</font></a>\r\n \r\n*Please Note*\r\nThe website VideoCodeZone.com is running a script for the links on this\r\npage.
