(\"S&S\").  The Trusts own all rights in and to the registered mark JOY OF COOKING (the \"Mark\"), which has been in continuous use in interstate commerce since the world-renowned book entitled \"Joy of Cooking\" by Irma S. Rombauer and Marion Becker was first published in 1931.  S&S is the exclusive licensee of the publishing and merchandising rights to the Mark in connection with cookbooks and all related collateral products and services (collectively, the \"Joy of Cooking Properties\").  As I am sure you are aware, the Book is quite probably the most famous cookbook ever published.  Indeed, millions of copies of the various editions of the Book have been sold since first publication.  As a result of these enormous sales and the attendant publicity, the public associates the Mark and its distinctive logo solely with the Trusts and S&S.  \r\n\r\nIt has come to our attention that you registered the domain name ","date_sent":"2005-01-20T05:00:00Z","date_received":"2005-01-20T05:00:00Z","topics":["Trademark","Copyright"],"sender_name":null,"principal_name":"Viacom/Simon & Schuster","recipient_name":null,"works":[{"description":"Unknown work","infringing_urls":[],"copyrighted_urls":[]}],"tags":[],"jurisdictions":[],"action_taken":"Yes","language":null}}
