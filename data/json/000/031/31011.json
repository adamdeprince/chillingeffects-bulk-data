It\r\nhas come to our attention that a website hosted on your network,\r\nwww.messenger--uk.com <http://www.messenger--uk.com/> , is using\r\nMicrosoft's WINDOWS LIVE trademark and a Microsoft \"Flag\" logo on its\r\nsite, which confuses and misleads computer users as to an affiliation\r\nwith or sponsorship by Microsoft. Microsoft has not authorized the owner\r\nof this website to use its trademarks in any fashion; in fact, the owner\r\nof the website is veiled behind a private registration through the\r\nregistrar GoDaddy's Domains By Proxy program. Moreover, the owner of the\r\nsite appears to be profiting from use of Microsoft's brands by charging\r\na fee for the download of the WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER 8.1 product, which\r\nis offered by Microsoft for free.  Such use of Microsoft's trademarks is\r\ndeceptive and misleading, for it causes computer users to mistakenly\r\nbelieve that this site is affiliated with or sponsored by Microsoft, and\r\nthat Microsoft has authorized the site's owner to offer its WINDOWS LIVE\r\nMESSENGER 8.1 product at a cost.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition, the owner of the site has taken content from Microsoft's\r\nown site - specifically, the sample screen shot - in violation of\r\ncopyright laws. See the sample screen shot shown on Microsoft's own site\r\nat: http://get.live.com/messenger/overview and view the copied content\r\nat www.messenger--uk.com <http://www.messenger--uk.com/> . \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI am writing to you today to report this egregious misuse of Microsoft's\r\nintellectual property as a violation of your Acceptable Use Policy and\r\nask you to assist us by reviewing the situation and considering removal\r\nof the website from your network. If you need to see information\r\nconcerning Microsoft's trademarks (WINDOWS LIVE and the Microsoft \"Flag\"\r\nlogo) in order to evaluate the situation, please let me know. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe believe the site to be hosted by your company based on the\r\ninformation:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nNetwork Whois record\r\n\r\n\r\nQueried whois.arin.net with \"74.52.234.178\"...\r\n\r\nOrgName:    ThePlanet.com Internet Services, Inc. \r\nOrgID:      TPCM\r\nAddress:    1333 North Stemmons Freeway\r\nAddress:    Suite 110\r\nCity:       Dallas\r\nStateProv:  TX\r\nPostalCode: 75207\r\nCountry:    US\r\n \r\nReferralServer: rwhois://rwhois.theplanet.com:4321\r\n \r\nNetRange:   74.52.0.0 - 74.53.255.255 \r\nCIDR:       74.52.0.0/15 \r\nNetName:    NETBLK-THEPLANET-BLK-14\r\nNetHandle:  NET-74-52-0-0-1\r\nParent:     NET-74-0-0-0-0\r\nNetType:    Direct Allocation\r\nNameServer: NS1.THEPLANET.COM\r\nNameServer: NS2.THEPLANET.COM\r\nComment:    \r\nRegDate:    2006-02-17\r\nUpdated:    2007-01-19\r\n \r\nRTechHandle: PP46-ARIN\r\nRTechName:   Pathos, Peter \r\nRTechPhone:  +1-214-782-7800\r\nRTechEmail:  admins@theplanet.com \r\n \r\nOrgAbuseHandle: ABUSE271-ARIN\r\nOrgAbuseName:   Abuse \r\nOrgAbusePhone:  +1-214-782-7802\r\nOrgAbuseEmail:  abuse@theplanet.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need additional information regarding this\r\nabuse report. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nUnder penalty of perjury, the undersigned confirms that she is\r\nauthorized to act on behalf of Microsoft Corporation in this matter.
