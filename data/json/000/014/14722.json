There is no  \ninformation listed on any of the infringing blogs. I believe it is an  \naffiliate client of mine in which case I would like to bill them and also \n\nto provide me with more insight into their business practices, as I would \n\nnot thus find them trustworthy.\n\nAlso google: please focus more attention on this problem, I find dozens\nand  \ndozens of copyright violations every time I look. Often the copycats\nappear  \nhigher in google search results. Previous violators still have my original\n \ncontent on their blogs (yes, I filed a DMCA)as well as Adsense. It really \n\nmakes for an unfair playing field for those of us who work hard to create \n\noriginal content and we are not compensated for the hours put in making  \ncomplaints.
