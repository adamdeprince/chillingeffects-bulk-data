This\r\nis the \r\nfourth case in less that a month where each of your customers assumes by\r\n\r\nclaiming they run a public poetry forum they can post copyright\r\nmaterial. \r\n \r\nThere is NO SUCH THING as a PUBLIC POETRY FORUM we are in contact with\r\nIndian \r\nand Pakistan Internet authorities and Governments to ensure this matter\r\nis \r\naddressed \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nQuoting admin@malluforum.com: \r\n \r\n> Mr C R Slater, \r\n> \r\n> We have removed the content you had claimed to have owning your\r\ncopyright. \r\n> You might have given at least 24 hours for us to read you message.

How can\r\nwe \r\n> know that its a copy righted material or not. You heard about phpbb?\r\nYou \r\n> heard about moderators in phpbb? You know what is an online community?\r\nYou \r\n> think we came to your website and stole your so called great works.\r\nMan \r\n> that stuff is posted by our fellow member. Like any body else he might\r\n\r\n> have got it as an email forward? You know what email forward is? You\r\nknow \r\n> what is email chain? Can you prosecute yahoo mail, gmail and hotmail\r\nfor \r\n> forwarding your content? If you can then go and do that. Other wise\r\nyou \r\n> will go on shouting against poor webmasters like us and ppl will read\r\nyour \r\n> so called great copyrighted contents via email. \r\n> \r\n> \"The webmaster has deliberately ignored endless requests to remove the\r\n\r\n> copyright published material and is clearly an out right criminal\r\nhiding \r\n> his own identity behind privacyprotect.org\" \r\n> \r\n> You might have given us proper time for us to read your email and\r\nrespond. \r\n> You think we are sitting 24/7 in front of the website watching any\r\nbody \r\n> sending emails. What you mean by endless email. You just send an email\r\n\r\n> when its midnight here when we were sleeping. Then you started saying \r\n> about criminal activity. Then you started talking with authorities.\r\nHow \r\n> pathetic. What a pity. Is this the way you behave with ppl? Its really\r\n\r\n> shame. If every material has to be slated for copyright checking how\r\ncan \r\n> we run a website. Then whats the point of creating phpbb, invision or \r\n> vbulletin. If you think your copyright has been violated you have to\r\ngive \r\n> us proper time to check the matter and do necessary actions. After all\r\nwe \r\n> are human beings. Things will take time. This is the way its done even\r\nby \r\n> companies like google, yahoo etc. If there is a copyright violation\r\nsend a \r\n> notice and wait for the action.
